We introduce ***ReCall***, a novel framework that trains LLMs to ***Re***ason with Tool ***Call*** via reinforcement learning—without requiring any supervised data on tool use trajectories or reasoning steps. *ReCall* empowers LLMs to agentically use and combine arbitrary tools like [OpenAI o3](https://openai.com/index/introducing-o3-and-o4-mini/), offering an accessible approach toward general-purpose agents. Additionally, we provide a novel perspective to generate synthetic data with diverse environments and complex multi-step tasks, enabling LLMs to develop sophisticated tool-based reasoning capabilities. This is a work in progress and we are actively working on it.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> *ReCall* is the successor to [*ReSearch*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19470) and represents a more comprehensive framework that extends beyond the search tool to support reasoning with any user-defined tools. It can be a drop-in replacement of *ReSearch*. We've archived the original implementation of *ReSearch* in the branch `re-search`.

## 📦 Installation

We recommend using conda to manage the environment. First create a conda environment and activate it.
```bash
conda create -n re-call python==3.10
conda activate re-call
```
Then install dependencies, and the packages under ```src/``` will be installed in the editable mode.  Check out ```setup.py``` for details.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Agent-RL/ReCall.git
cd ReCall
pip3 install -e .
pip3 install flash-attn==2.7.4.post1 --no-build-isolation
pip install math_verify
```
If you want to host a Wikipedia RAG system based on FlashRAG, you need to install faiss-gpu as follow. As described in the [FlashRAG](https://github.com/RUC-NLPIR/FlashRAG?tab=readme-ov-file#wrench-installation), due to the incompatibility when installing faiss using pip, we need to use the following conda command to install faiss-gpu.
```bash
conda install -c pytorch -c nvidia faiss-gpu=1.8.0
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

> If you want to learn the details of current version of *ReCall*, please refer to the [blog](https://attractive-almandine-935.notion.site/ReCall-Learning-to-Reason-with-Tool-Call-for-LLMs-via-Reinforcement-Learning-1d7aec91e9bb8006ad40f9edbfe2191a) first.

### Data Preparation

*ReCall* is trained on a mixture of our synthetic dataset `SynTool` and the training set of `MuSiQue`. You can download the preprocessed training data from [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/agentrl/ReCall-data), and use such data directly for training. For preparing your own data with specific tools, you can refer to the `data/prepare_musique_recall.py`, where we provide the script of preparing the data for MuSiQue with Wikipedia search tool.

### Sandbox Serving

Since tools are implemented in executable Python code, the tool executor is responsible for running the Python code. To ensure safety and security, we implement a sandbox for running Python code on a remote server. To launch the sandbox service, run the following command:
```bash
cd scripts/serving
python sandbox.py --port {port}
```
Note: The current implementation is a basic sandbox environment. We plan to use a more robust and secure sandbox in future updates. We recommend hosting the sandbox on a remote server, as local hosting may expose your machine to potential security risks.

### Retriever Serving

For training on MuSiQue data with a Wikipedia search tool, we provide a Wikipedia retriever service implemented using FlashRAG and FastAPI. Before starting the retriever serving, you need download the [pre-indexed wikipedia](https://github.com/RUC-NLPIR/FlashRAG?tab=readme-ov-file#index), [wikipedia corpus and corresponding retriever models](https://github.com/RUC-NLPIR/FlashRAG/blob/main/docs/original_docs/reproduce_experiment.md#preliminary). More details can be found in the documentation of FlashRAG.

For starting the retriever serving, you need to first fill the `scripts/serving/retriever_config.yaml` with the correct path to the retrieval model, index, and corpus, and available GPU ids. Then, you can run the following command to start the retriever serving:
```bash
cd scripts/serving
python retriever_serving.py \
    --config retriever_config.yaml \
    --num_retriever {num_retriever} \  
    --port {port}
```

### Training

Our training framework is based on [verl](https://github.com/volcengine/verl), a powerful reinforcement learning framework for LLMs. We deeply customize the verl code to fit our needs, and the modified version of verl is under the `src/verl` directory. The example of training scripts are under `scripts/train`.

#### Single-node training
Here is an example of training Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct with 4 GPUs locally. Note that the training script below **is just an example** for single-node training, using small batch size for quick start, and do not assure the training performance.
```bash
cd scripts/train
bash train.sh \
    --train_batch_size 8 \
    --ppo_mini_batch_size 4 \
    --use_re_call True \
    --prompt_template_name re_call_template_sys \
    --actor_model_path {model/path/to/qwen2.5-7b-instruct} \
    --search_url {your-hosted-retriever-url} \
    --sandbox_url {your-hosted-sandbox-url} \
    --project_name {wandb-project-name} \
    --experiment_name {wandb-experiment-name} \
    --nnodes 1 \
    --n_gpus_per_node 4 \
    --save_freq 5 \
    --test_freq 5 \
    --total_epochs 2 \  
    --wandb_api_key {your-wandb-api-key} \
    --save_path {path/to/save} \
    --train_files "['train1.parquet', 'train2.parquet']" \
    --test_files "['test1.parquet', 'test2.parquet']"
```

#### Multi-node training

If you want to **fully reproduce** *ReCall*, please refer to the multi-node training script in `scripts/train/train_multi_node.sh`.

### Inference
This section demonstrates how to perform inference using the trained *ReCall* model. We provide a standard wrapper class in `src/re_call/inference/re_call.py` that simplifies the inference process. To get started, you only need to provide the model URL and sandbox URL, then use the `run` function to execute inference. The `ReCall` class handles all the orchestration between model generation and tool execution internally. For a practical example of using the `ReCall` class, please refer to our sample implementation at `scripts/inference/re_call_use_case.py`.
 
For model serving, we recommend using [SGLang](https://docs.sglang.ai/). You can either download our open-source models or train your own models to conduct the inference. Here is an example of how to launch the model service:
```bash
python3 -m sglang.launch_server \
        --served-model-name {trained/model/name} \
        --model-path {trained/model/path} \
        --tp 2 \
        --context-length 8192 \
        --enable-metrics \
        --dtype bfloat16 \
        --host 0.0.0.0 \
        --port 80 \
        --trust-remote-code \
        --disable-overlap \
        --disable-radix-cache
```

### Evaluation

#### Multi-hop QA

For the evaluation on multi-hop QA, we use [FlashRAG](https://github.com/RUC-NLPIR/FlashRAG) as the standard evaluation environment. For downloading the evaluation data, please run the following command:
```bash
cd data
bash download_dataset.sh
```
Here is an example of evaluating the performance of ReCall-Qwen-7B-Instruct on Bamboogle test set.
```bash
cd scripts/evaluation
python run_eval.py \
    --config_path eval_config.yaml \
    --method_name re-call \
    --data_dir {root/path/to/evaluation/data} \
    --dataset_name bamboogle \
    --split test \
    --save_dir {your-save-dir} \
    --save_note re-call_qwen7b_ins
    --sgl_remote_url {your-launched-sgl-url} \
    --remote_retriever_url {your-hosted-retriever-url} \
    --generator_model {your-local-model-path} \
    --sandbox_url {your-hosted-sandbox-url}
```
For more details about the configuration, please refer to the `scripts/evaluation/eval_config.yaml` file. 

#### BFCL
We will release the evaluation code on BFCL soon.
