If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3.

You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film.

If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3.

DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film.

If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3.

DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US?

You need to output \"Unsolved\" or \"Solved\" and your reason. You must obey the following rules:\n\nYou should response \"Solved\" when:\n    1. If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3.

DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film.

Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project. Can you help me find a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide me with the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' and the basic information about the cast, including their names and professions.\nAnswer 2: The movie 'Citizen Kane' is available on the following streaming platforms:\n- HBO Max: [Watch on HBO Max](https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXduU_gwwz-NvjAEAAAAC)\n- Amazon Prime Video: [Watch on Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Kane-Orson-Welles/dp/B000I9YLWG)\n- AppleTV+: [Watch on AppleTV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/citizen-kane/umc.cmc.21zj0v11gnqbbqrebieh0vpk7)\n- Disney+: Available on Disney+\n- Netflix: Available on Netflix\nAnswer Status: Unsolved\nReason: The answer only addressed the first and second part of the query by providing the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' but did not provide information about the cast or a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US. The response was incomplete and did not fully address the query.\n\nQuery: \nRecommend the best version of C to compile my C code. I want to ensure compatibility and efficiency.

        "llm_judge_prompt": "\nGiven a query and an answer provided by an AI agent, you now need to determine the answer_status of whether the well solved the query, i.e. whether the need of the query is satisfied. You need to output \"Unsolved\" or \"Solved\" and your reason. You must obey the following rules:\n\nYou should response \"Solved\" when:\n    1. If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3. Severe Factual Error:\n        \u2022   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n    1. VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide the runtime and IMDb ratings for these movies.\nAnswer 1: Here are some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US:\n\n1. Knives Out\n   - Runtime: 130 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 7.9/10\n   - Available on: Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video\n\n2. Jumanji: The Next Level\n   - Runtime: 110 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 6.7/10\n   - Available on: Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix\n\nPlease note that availability may vary depending on your location and streaming platform subscriptions. Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project. Can you help me find a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide me with the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' and the basic information about the cast, including their names and professions.\nAnswer 2: The movie 'Citizen Kane' is available on the following streaming platforms:\n- HBO Max: [Watch on HBO Max](https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXduU_gwwz-NvjAEAAAAC)\n- Amazon Prime Video: [Watch on Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Kane-Orson-Welles/dp/B000I9YLWG)\n- AppleTV+: [Watch on AppleTV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/citizen-kane/umc.cmc.21zj0v11gnqbbqrebieh0vpk7)\n- Disney+: Available on Disney+\n- Netflix: Available on Netflix\nAnswer Status: Unsolved\nReason: The answer only addressed the first and second part of the query by providing the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' but did not provide information about the cast or a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US. The response was incomplete and did not fully address the query.\n\nQuery: \nI am working on a project that involves anonymizing images by hiding faces and car license plates. Can you provide me with the available modes for achieving this? Also, I would like to know the current version of the Image Anonymization service.\nAnswer: \nAvailable modes: ['hide-clp', 'hide-face'], Current version: v1.16.2\n\nNow give your reason and answer status in the following format:\n\nAnswer Status\nxxx (can only be \"Solved\" or \"Unsolved\")\nReason\nxxx\n"

If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3.

You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film.

If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3.

Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film.

Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project.

You need to output \"Unsolved\" or \"Solved\" and your reason. You must obey the following rules:\n\nYou should response \"Solved\" when:\n    1. If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3.

DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film.

If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3.

VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US?

Knives Out\n   - Runtime: 130 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 7.9/10\n   - Available on: Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video\n\n2. Jumanji: The Next Level\n   - Runtime: 110 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 6.7/10\n   - Available on: Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix\n\nPlease note that availability may vary depending on your location and streaming platform subscriptions. Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project. Can you help me find a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide me with the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' and the basic information about the cast, including their names and professions.\nAnswer 2: The movie 'Citizen Kane' is available on the following streaming platforms:\n- HBO Max: [Watch on HBO Max](https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXduU_gwwz-NvjAEAAAAC)\n- Amazon Prime Video: [Watch on Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Kane-Orson-Welles/dp/B000I9YLWG)\n- AppleTV+: [Watch on AppleTV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/citizen-kane/umc.cmc.21zj0v11gnqbbqrebieh0vpk7)\n- Disney+: Available on Disney+\n- Netflix: Available on Netflix\nAnswer Status: Unsolved\nReason: The answer only addressed the first and second part of the query by providing the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' but did not provide information about the cast or a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US. The response was incomplete and did not fully address the query.\n\nQuery: \nCould you please provide me with a random set of colors using the ColorMe tool?

If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3.

        "llm_judge_prompt": "\nGiven a query and an answer provided by an AI agent, you now need to determine the answer_status of whether the well solved the query, i.e. whether the need of the query is satisfied. You need to output \"Unsolved\" or \"Solved\" and your reason. You must obey the following rules:\n\nYou should response \"Solved\" when:\n    1. If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3. Severe Factual Error:\n        \u2022   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n    1. VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide the runtime and IMDb ratings for these movies.\nAnswer 1: Here are some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US:\n\n1.

You need to output \"Unsolved\" or \"Solved\" and your reason. You must obey the following rules:\n\nYou should response \"Solved\" when:\n    1. If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3.

Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film.

If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3.

DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US?

Knives Out\n   - Runtime: 130 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 7.9/10\n   - Available on: Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video\n\n2. Jumanji: The Next Level\n   - Runtime: 110 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 6.7/10\n   - Available on: Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix\n\nPlease note that availability may vary depending on your location and streaming platform subscriptions. Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project. Can you help me find a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide me with the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' and the basic information about the cast, including their names and professions.\nAnswer 2: The movie 'Citizen Kane' is available on the following streaming platforms:\n- HBO Max: [Watch on HBO Max](https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXduU_gwwz-NvjAEAAAAC)\n- Amazon Prime Video: [Watch on Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Kane-Orson-Welles/dp/B000I9YLWG)\n- AppleTV+: [Watch on AppleTV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/citizen-kane/umc.cmc.21zj0v11gnqbbqrebieh0vpk7)\n- Disney+: Available on Disney+\n- Netflix: Available on Netflix\nAnswer Status: Unsolved\nReason: The answer only addressed the first and second part of the query by providing the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' but did not provide information about the cast or a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US. The response was incomplete and did not fully address the query.\n\nQuery: \nI need to find the categories of products available in the catalog. Can you provide me with a list of all the categories?

If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3.

DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide the runtime and IMDb ratings for these movies.\nAnswer 1: Here are some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US:\n\n1. Knives Out\n   - Runtime: 130 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 7.9/10\n   - Available on: Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video\n\n2. Jumanji: The Next Level\n   - Runtime: 110 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 6.7/10\n   - Available on: Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix\n\nPlease note that availability may vary depending on your location and streaming platform subscriptions. Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project. Can you help me find a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide me with the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' and the basic information about the cast, including their names and professions.\nAnswer 2: The movie 'Citizen Kane' is available on the following streaming platforms:\n- HBO Max: [Watch on HBO Max](https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXduU_gwwz-NvjAEAAAAC)\n- Amazon Prime Video: [Watch on Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Kane-Orson-Welles/dp/B000I9YLWG)\n- AppleTV+: [Watch on AppleTV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/citizen-kane/umc.cmc.21zj0v11gnqbbqrebieh0vpk7)\n- Disney+: Available on Disney+\n- Netflix: Available on Netflix\nAnswer Status: Unsolved\nReason: The answer only addressed the first and second part of the query by providing the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' but did not provide information about the cast or a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US. The response was incomplete and did not fully address the query.\n\nQuery: \nCan you help me calculate the KDA (kill + assists death ratio) using 5 kills, 3 assists, and 2 deaths? Additionally, convert the username 'player123' into a UUID.\nAnswer: \nKDA: 3.2, UUID: 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000\n\nNow give your reason and answer status in the following format:\n\nAnswer Status\nxxx (can only be \"Solved\" or \"Unsolved\")\nReason\nxxx\n"

If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3.

Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film.

If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3.

You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film.

If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3. Severe Factual Error:\n        \u2022   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n    1. VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US?

Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project. Can you help me find a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide me with the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' and the basic information about the cast, including their names and professions.\nAnswer 2: The movie 'Citizen Kane' is available on the following streaming platforms:\n- HBO Max: [Watch on HBO Max](https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXduU_gwwz-NvjAEAAAAC)\n- Amazon Prime Video: [Watch on Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Kane-Orson-Welles/dp/B000I9YLWG)\n- AppleTV+: [Watch on AppleTV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/citizen-kane/umc.cmc.21zj0v11gnqbbqrebieh0vpk7)\n- Disney+: Available on Disney+\n- Netflix: Available on Netflix\nAnswer Status: Unsolved\nReason: The answer only addressed the first and second part of the query by providing the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' but did not provide information about the cast or a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US.

If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3.

Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film.

The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3. Severe Factual Error:\n        \u2022   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n    1. VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide the runtime and IMDb ratings for these movies.\nAnswer 1: Here are some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US:\n\n1. Knives Out\n   - Runtime: 130 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 7.9/10\n   - Available on: Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video\n\n2. Jumanji: The Next Level\n   - Runtime: 110 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 6.7/10\n   - Available on: Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix\n\nPlease note that availability may vary depending on your location and streaming platform subscriptions. Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project. Can you help me find a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide me with the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' and the basic information about the cast, including their names and professions.\nAnswer 2: The movie 'Citizen Kane' is available on the following streaming platforms:\n- HBO Max: [Watch on HBO Max](https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXduU_gwwz-NvjAEAAAAC)\n- Amazon Prime Video: [Watch on Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Kane-Orson-Welles/dp/B000I9YLWG)\n- AppleTV+: [Watch on AppleTV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/citizen-kane/umc.cmc.21zj0v11gnqbbqrebieh0vpk7)\n- Disney+: Available on Disney+\n- Netflix: Available on Netflix\nAnswer Status: Unsolved\nReason: The answer only addressed the first and second part of the query by providing the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' but did not provide information about the cast or a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US. The response was incomplete and did not fully address the query.\n\nQuery: \nI'm a freelance content writer and I'm looking for trending keywords in the field of technology. Can you suggest some high-volume keywords related to technology? I would appreciate it if you could also provide the competition level and CPC for these keywords. Additionally, I'm curious about the global results for the keyword 'technology'.\nAnswer: \n['technology': {'cpc': 0.624, 'vol': 186000, 'v': 186000, 'competition': 'low', 'score': 0.065}, 'technological innovation': {'cpc': 0.228, 'vol': 1100, 'v': 1100, 'competition': 'low', 'score': 0.044}, 'technological advancements': {'cpc': 0.162, 'vol': 1100, 'v': 1100, 'competition': 'low', 'score': 0.036}, 'Global Results for technology: {'text': 'technology', 'cpc': 0.624, 'vol': 186000, 'v': 186000, 'competition': 'low', 'score': 0.065}\n\nNow give your reason and answer status in the following format:\n\nAnswer Status\nxxx (can only be \"Solved\" or \"Unsolved\")\nReason\nxxx\n"

If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3.

You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film.

The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3. Severe Factual Error:\n        \u2022   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n    1. VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide the runtime and IMDb ratings for these movies.\nAnswer 1: Here are some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US:\n\n1. Knives Out\n   - Runtime: 130 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 7.9/10\n   - Available on: Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video\n\n2. Jumanji: The Next Level\n   - Runtime: 110 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 6.7/10\n   - Available on: Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix\n\nPlease note that availability may vary depending on your location and streaming platform subscriptions. Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project. Can you help me find a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide me with the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' and the basic information about the cast, including their names and professions.\nAnswer 2: The movie 'Citizen Kane' is available on the following streaming platforms:\n- HBO Max: [Watch on HBO Max](https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXduU_gwwz-NvjAEAAAAC)\n- Amazon Prime Video: [Watch on Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Kane-Orson-Welles/dp/B000I9YLWG)\n- AppleTV+: [Watch on AppleTV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/citizen-kane/umc.cmc.21zj0v11gnqbbqrebieh0vpk7)\n- Disney+: Available on Disney+\n- Netflix: Available on Netflix\nAnswer Status: Unsolved\nReason: The answer only addressed the first and second part of the query by providing the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' but did not provide information about the cast or a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US. The response was incomplete and did not fully address the query.\n\nQuery: \nI am developing a chat application and I want to filter out any profanity in the user messages. Can you recommend an API that can check if a text contains profanity? It would be great if the API can also provide suggestions to replace the offensive words with appropriate alternatives.\nAnswer: \nPurgoMalum API\n\nNow give your reason and answer status in the following format:\n\nAnswer Status\nxxx (can only be \"Solved\" or \"Unsolved\")\nReason\nxxx\n"

If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3.

You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film.

If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3.

You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film.

        "llm_judge_prompt": "\nGiven a query and an answer provided by an AI agent, you now need to determine the answer_status of whether the well solved the query, i.e. whether the need of the query is satisfied. You need to output \"Unsolved\" or \"Solved\" and your reason. You must obey the following rules:\n\nYou should response \"Solved\" when:\n    1. If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3. Severe Factual Error:\n        \u2022   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n    1.

DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide the runtime and IMDb ratings for these movies.\nAnswer 1: Here are some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US:\n\n1. Knives Out\n   - Runtime: 130 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 7.9/10\n   - Available on: Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video\n\n2. Jumanji: The Next Level\n   - Runtime: 110 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 6.7/10\n   - Available on: Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix\n\nPlease note that availability may vary depending on your location and streaming platform subscriptions. Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project. Can you help me find a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide me with the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' and the basic information about the cast, including their names and professions.\nAnswer 2: The movie 'Citizen Kane' is available on the following streaming platforms:\n- HBO Max: [Watch on HBO Max](https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXduU_gwwz-NvjAEAAAAC)\n- Amazon Prime Video: [Watch on Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Kane-Orson-Welles/dp/B000I9YLWG)\n- AppleTV+: [Watch on AppleTV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/citizen-kane/umc.cmc.21zj0v11gnqbbqrebieh0vpk7)\n- Disney+: Available on Disney+\n- Netflix: Available on Netflix\nAnswer Status: Unsolved\nReason: The answer only addressed the first and second part of the query by providing the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' but did not provide information about the cast or a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US. The response was incomplete and did not fully address the query.\n\nQuery: \nI'm analyzing the content of a PDF document. I need to retrieve all the texts in the PDF, along with their corresponding page numbers. Additionally, I would like to extract the texts on a specific page. Can you assist me with these tasks?\nAnswer: \nAll texts: [{\"text\": \"This is the first text.\", \"page\": 1}, {\"text\": \"This is the second text.\", \"page\": 2}, {\"text\": \"This is the third text.\", \"page\": 2}], Page 2 texts: [{\"text\": \"This is the second text.\", \"page\": 2}, {\"text\": \"This is the third text.\", \"page\": 2}]\n\nNow give your reason and answer status in the following format:\n\nAnswer Status\nxxx (can only be \"Solved\" or \"Unsolved\")\nReason\nxxx\n"

The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3. Severe Factual Error:\n        \u2022   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n    1. VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide the runtime and IMDb ratings for these movies.\nAnswer 1: Here are some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US:\n\n1. Knives Out\n   - Runtime: 130 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 7.9/10\n   - Available on: Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video\n\n2. Jumanji: The Next Level\n   - Runtime: 110 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 6.7/10\n   - Available on: Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix\n\nPlease note that availability may vary depending on your location and streaming platform subscriptions. Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project. Can you help me find a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide me with the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' and the basic information about the cast, including their names and professions.\nAnswer 2: The movie 'Citizen Kane' is available on the following streaming platforms:\n- HBO Max: [Watch on HBO Max](https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXduU_gwwz-NvjAEAAAAC)\n- Amazon Prime Video: [Watch on Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Kane-Orson-Welles/dp/B000I9YLWG)\n- AppleTV+: [Watch on AppleTV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/citizen-kane/umc.cmc.21zj0v11gnqbbqrebieh0vpk7)\n- Disney+: Available on Disney+\n- Netflix: Available on Netflix\nAnswer Status: Unsolved\nReason: The answer only addressed the first and second part of the query by providing the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' but did not provide information about the cast or a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US. The response was incomplete and did not fully address the query.\n\nQuery: \nI need to retrieve the details of specific tasks assigned to my team and generate time reports for a specific team. Please provide the task codes 12, 23, and 34 along with the team ID 45678. The format of the response should be in CSV.\nAnswer: \nBEGIN:VCARD\\nVERSION:3.0\\nN:;;Team Time Reports;;\\nTITLE:Team Time Reports\\nADR:;;;;\\nEMAIL;TYPE=PREF,INTERNET:team@tesla.com\\nTEL;TYPE=FAX:++1.650.555.4294\\nTEL;TYPE=WORK;VOICE:++1.650.555.3521\\nREV:20231129T060636Z\\nEND:VCARD\n\nNow give your reason and answer status in the following format:\n\nAnswer Status\nxxx (can only be \"Solved\" or \"Unsolved\")\nReason\nxxx\n"

        "llm_judge_prompt": "\nGiven a query and an answer provided by an AI agent, you now need to determine the answer_status of whether the well solved the query, i.e. whether the need of the query is satisfied. You need to output \"Unsolved\" or \"Solved\" and your reason. You must obey the following rules:\n\nYou should response \"Solved\" when:\n    1. If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3. Severe Factual Error:\n        \u2022   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n    1.

DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film.

Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project.

Also, provide me with the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' and the basic information about the cast, including their names and professions.\nAnswer 2: The movie 'Citizen Kane' is available on the following streaming platforms:\n- HBO Max: [Watch on HBO Max](https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXduU_gwwz-NvjAEAAAAC)\n- Amazon Prime Video: [Watch on Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Kane-Orson-Welles/dp/B000I9YLWG)\n- AppleTV+: [Watch on AppleTV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/citizen-kane/umc.cmc.21zj0v11gnqbbqrebieh0vpk7)\n- Disney+: Available on Disney+\n- Netflix: Available on Netflix\nAnswer Status: Unsolved\nReason: The answer only addressed the first and second part of the query by providing the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' but did not provide information about the cast or a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US. The response was incomplete and did not fully address the query.\n\nQuery: \nI'm developing a photo editing app and I want to offer users the option to apply a charcoal filter to their images. Is there an API that can apply a charcoal effect to images? Additionally, I'd like to provide a 'wasted' effect where an image is distorted and overlaid with text. Is there an API that can help with that?\nAnswer: \nCharcoal Filter URL: https://example.com/sample-image-charcoal.jpg, Wasted Effect URL: https://example.com/sample-image-wasted.jpg\n\nNow give your reason and answer status in the following format:\n\nAnswer Status\nxxx (can only be \"Solved\" or \"Unsolved\")\nReason\nxxx\n"

If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3.

You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US?

Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project. Can you help me find a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide me with the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' and the basic information about the cast, including their names and professions.\nAnswer 2: The movie 'Citizen Kane' is available on the following streaming platforms:\n- HBO Max: [Watch on HBO Max](https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXduU_gwwz-NvjAEAAAAC)\n- Amazon Prime Video: [Watch on Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Kane-Orson-Welles/dp/B000I9YLWG)\n- AppleTV+: [Watch on AppleTV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/citizen-kane/umc.cmc.21zj0v11gnqbbqrebieh0vpk7)\n- Disney+: Available on Disney+\n- Netflix: Available on Netflix\nAnswer Status: Unsolved\nReason: The answer only addressed the first and second part of the query by providing the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' but did not provide information about the cast or a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US. The response was incomplete and did not fully address the query.\n\nQuery: \nMy company is planning to deploy IoT devices and we want to ensure their security. Can you analyze the firmware of these devices and provide a risk assessment? It would be helpful to check for weak certificates, expired certificates, and weak keys. Thank you!\nAnswer: \nWeak Certificates: ['cert1', 'cert2'], Expired Certificates: ['cert3', 'cert4'], Weak Keys: ['key1', 'key2']\n\nNow give your reason and answer status in the following format:\n\nAnswer Status\nxxx (can only be \"Solved\" or \"Unsolved\")\nReason\nxxx\n"

The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3. Severe Factual Error:\n        \u2022   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n    1. VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide the runtime and IMDb ratings for these movies.\nAnswer 1: Here are some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US:\n\n1. Knives Out\n   - Runtime: 130 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 7.9/10\n   - Available on: Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video\n\n2. Jumanji: The Next Level\n   - Runtime: 110 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 6.7/10\n   - Available on: Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix\n\nPlease note that availability may vary depending on your location and streaming platform subscriptions. Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project. Can you help me find a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide me with the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' and the basic information about the cast, including their names and professions.\nAnswer 2: The movie 'Citizen Kane' is available on the following streaming platforms:\n- HBO Max: [Watch on HBO Max](https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXduU_gwwz-NvjAEAAAAC)\n- Amazon Prime Video: [Watch on Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Kane-Orson-Welles/dp/B000I9YLWG)\n- AppleTV+: [Watch on AppleTV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/citizen-kane/umc.cmc.21zj0v11gnqbbqrebieh0vpk7)\n- Disney+: Available on Disney+\n- Netflix: Available on Netflix\nAnswer Status: Unsolved\nReason: The answer only addressed the first and second part of the query by providing the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' but did not provide information about the cast or a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US. The response was incomplete and did not fully address the query.\n\nQuery: \nI have a document that needs to be checked for profanity. Can you remove any profane words from the text and replace them with asterisks? Also, please let me know if the document contains any profanity.\nAnswer: \nDocument contains profanity: True, Cleaned Document: 'This is a test document with some bad words like **** and ****.'\n\nNow give your reason and answer status in the following format:\n\nAnswer Status\nxxx (can only be \"Solved\" or \"Unsolved\")\nReason\nxxx\n"

You need to output \"Unsolved\" or \"Solved\" and your reason. You must obey the following rules:\n\nYou should response \"Solved\" when:\n    1. If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3.

DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide the runtime and IMDb ratings for these movies.\nAnswer 1: Here are some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US:\n\n1. Knives Out\n   - Runtime: 130 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 7.9/10\n   - Available on: Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video\n\n2. Jumanji: The Next Level\n   - Runtime: 110 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 6.7/10\n   - Available on: Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix\n\nPlease note that availability may vary depending on your location and streaming platform subscriptions. Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project. Can you help me find a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide me with the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' and the basic information about the cast, including their names and professions.\nAnswer 2: The movie 'Citizen Kane' is available on the following streaming platforms:\n- HBO Max: [Watch on HBO Max](https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXduU_gwwz-NvjAEAAAAC)\n- Amazon Prime Video: [Watch on Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Kane-Orson-Welles/dp/B000I9YLWG)\n- AppleTV+: [Watch on AppleTV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/citizen-kane/umc.cmc.21zj0v11gnqbbqrebieh0vpk7)\n- Disney+: Available on Disney+\n- Netflix: Available on Netflix\nAnswer Status: Unsolved\nReason: The answer only addressed the first and second part of the query by providing the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' but did not provide information about the cast or a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US. The response was incomplete and did not fully address the query.\n\nQuery: \nI need to check the availability of a domain name for my family's upcoming event website.

If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3. Severe Factual Error:\n        \u2022   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n    1.

DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film.

If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3.

DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film.

If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3. Severe Factual Error:\n        \u2022   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n    1. VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide the runtime and IMDb ratings for these movies.\nAnswer 1: Here are some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US:\n\n1. Knives Out\n   - Runtime: 130 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 7.9/10\n   - Available on: Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video\n\n2.

Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings.

If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3.

You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide the runtime and IMDb ratings for these movies.\nAnswer 1: Here are some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US:\n\n1. Knives Out\n   - Runtime: 130 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 7.9/10\n   - Available on: Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video\n\n2. Jumanji: The Next Level\n   - Runtime: 110 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 6.7/10\n   - Available on: Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix\n\nPlease note that availability may vary depending on your location and streaming platform subscriptions. Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project.

If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3.

You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film.

This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3.

Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film.

        "llm_judge_prompt": "\nGiven a query and an answer provided by an AI agent, you now need to determine the answer_status of whether the well solved the query, i.e. whether the need of the query is satisfied. You need to output \"Unsolved\" or \"Solved\" and your reason. You must obey the following rules:\n\nYou should response \"Solved\" when:\n    1. If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3. Severe Factual Error:\n        \u2022   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n    1. VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide the runtime and IMDb ratings for these movies.\nAnswer 1: Here are some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US:\n\n1. Knives Out\n   - Runtime: 130 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 7.9/10\n   - Available on: Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video\n\n2. Jumanji: The Next Level\n   - Runtime: 110 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 6.7/10\n   - Available on: Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix\n\nPlease note that availability may vary depending on your location and streaming platform subscriptions. Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project. Can you help me find a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide me with the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' and the basic information about the cast, including their names and professions.\nAnswer 2: The movie 'Citizen Kane' is available on the following streaming platforms:\n- HBO Max: [Watch on HBO Max](https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXduU_gwwz-NvjAEAAAAC)\n- Amazon Prime Video: [Watch on Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Kane-Orson-Welles/dp/B000I9YLWG)\n- AppleTV+: [Watch on AppleTV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/citizen-kane/umc.cmc.21zj0v11gnqbbqrebieh0vpk7)\n- Disney+: Available on Disney+\n- Netflix: Available on Netflix\nAnswer Status: Unsolved\nReason: The answer only addressed the first and second part of the query by providing the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' but did not provide information about the cast or a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US. The response was incomplete and did not fully address the query.\n\nQuery: \nI am a developer working on an online code execution project. Can you provide me with the general information about Judge0 CE? Additionally, I would like to know the available languages and their respective compile and run commands.\nAnswer: \nno answer\n\nNow give your reason and answer status in the following format:\n\nAnswer Status\nxxx (can only be \"Solved\" or \"Unsolved\")\nReason\nxxx\n"

        "llm_judge_prompt": "\nGiven a query and an answer provided by an AI agent, you now need to determine the answer_status of whether the well solved the query, i.e. whether the need of the query is satisfied. You need to output \"Unsolved\" or \"Solved\" and your reason. You must obey the following rules:\n\nYou should response \"Solved\" when:\n    1. If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3. Severe Factual Error:\n        \u2022   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n    1. VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide the runtime and IMDb ratings for these movies.\nAnswer 1: Here are some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US:\n\n1. Knives Out\n   - Runtime: 130 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 7.9/10\n   - Available on: Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video\n\n2. Jumanji: The Next Level\n   - Runtime: 110 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 6.7/10\n   - Available on: Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix\n\nPlease note that availability may vary depending on your location and streaming platform subscriptions. Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project. Can you help me find a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide me with the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' and the basic information about the cast, including their names and professions.\nAnswer 2: The movie 'Citizen Kane' is available on the following streaming platforms:\n- HBO Max: [Watch on HBO Max](https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXduU_gwwz-NvjAEAAAAC)\n- Amazon Prime Video: [Watch on Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Kane-Orson-Welles/dp/B000I9YLWG)\n- AppleTV+: [Watch on AppleTV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/citizen-kane/umc.cmc.21zj0v11gnqbbqrebieh0vpk7)\n- Disney+: Available on Disney+\n- Netflix: Available on Netflix\nAnswer Status: Unsolved\nReason: The answer only addressed the first and second part of the query by providing the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' but did not provide information about the cast or a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US. The response was incomplete and did not fully address the query.\n\nQuery: \nI'm a phone enthusiast and want to learn more about different phone brands.

If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3. Severe Factual Error:\n        \u2022   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n    1. VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide the runtime and IMDb ratings for these movies.\nAnswer 1: Here are some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US:\n\n1. Knives Out\n   - Runtime: 130 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 7.9/10\n   - Available on: Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video\n\n2. Jumanji: The Next Level\n   - Runtime: 110 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 6.7/10\n   - Available on: Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix\n\nPlease note that availability may vary depending on your location and streaming platform subscriptions. Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project. Can you help me find a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide me with the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' and the basic information about the cast, including their names and professions.\nAnswer 2: The movie 'Citizen Kane' is available on the following streaming platforms:\n- HBO Max: [Watch on HBO Max](https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXduU_gwwz-NvjAEAAAAC)\n- Amazon Prime Video: [Watch on Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Kane-Orson-Welles/dp/B000I9YLWG)\n- AppleTV+: [Watch on AppleTV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/citizen-kane/umc.cmc.21zj0v11gnqbbqrebieh0vpk7)\n- Disney+: Available on Disney+\n- Netflix: Available on Netflix\nAnswer Status: Unsolved\nReason: The answer only addressed the first and second part of the query by providing the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' but did not provide information about the cast or a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US. The response was incomplete and did not fully address the query.\n\nQuery: \nHey, can you help me with generating a QR code? I want a QR code for my business card. The text I want to encode is 'John Doe, CEO of ABC Company, contact: john@abccompany.com'.\nAnswer: \nQR Code Image\n\nNow give your reason and answer status in the following format:\n\nAnswer Status\nxxx (can only be \"Solved\" or \"Unsolved\")\nReason\nxxx\n"

If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3. Severe Factual Error:\n        \u2022   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n    1. VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US?

Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project. Can you help me find a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide me with the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' and the basic information about the cast, including their names and professions.\nAnswer 2: The movie 'Citizen Kane' is available on the following streaming platforms:\n- HBO Max: [Watch on HBO Max](https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXduU_gwwz-NvjAEAAAAC)\n- Amazon Prime Video: [Watch on Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Kane-Orson-Welles/dp/B000I9YLWG)\n- AppleTV+: [Watch on AppleTV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/citizen-kane/umc.cmc.21zj0v11gnqbbqrebieh0vpk7)\n- Disney+: Available on Disney+\n- Netflix: Available on Netflix\nAnswer Status: Unsolved\nReason: The answer only addressed the first and second part of the query by providing the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' but did not provide information about the cast or a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US.

You need to output \"Unsolved\" or \"Solved\" and your reason. You must obey the following rules:\n\nYou should response \"Solved\" when:\n    1. If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3.

DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide the runtime and IMDb ratings for these movies.\nAnswer 1: Here are some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US:\n\n1. Knives Out\n   - Runtime: 130 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 7.9/10\n   - Available on: Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video\n\n2. Jumanji: The Next Level\n   - Runtime: 110 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 6.7/10\n   - Available on: Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix\n\nPlease note that availability may vary depending on your location and streaming platform subscriptions. Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project. Can you help me find a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide me with the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' and the basic information about the cast, including their names and professions.\nAnswer 2: The movie 'Citizen Kane' is available on the following streaming platforms:\n- HBO Max: [Watch on HBO Max](https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXduU_gwwz-NvjAEAAAAC)\n- Amazon Prime Video: [Watch on Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Kane-Orson-Welles/dp/B000I9YLWG)\n- AppleTV+: [Watch on AppleTV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/citizen-kane/umc.cmc.21zj0v11gnqbbqrebieh0vpk7)\n- Disney+: Available on Disney+\n- Netflix: Available on Netflix\nAnswer Status: Unsolved\nReason: The answer only addressed the first and second part of the query by providing the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' but did not provide information about the cast or a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US. The response was incomplete and did not fully address the query.\n\nQuery: \nI'm planning to send a package through Correo Argentino.

You need to output \"Unsolved\" or \"Solved\" and your reason. You must obey the following rules:\n\nYou should response \"Solved\" when:\n    1. If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3. Severe Factual Error:\n        \u2022   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n    1. VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film.

Knives Out\n   - Runtime: 130 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 7.9/10\n   - Available on: Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video\n\n2. Jumanji: The Next Level\n   - Runtime: 110 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 6.7/10\n   - Available on: Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix\n\nPlease note that availability may vary depending on your location and streaming platform subscriptions. Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project. Can you help me find a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide me with the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' and the basic information about the cast, including their names and professions.\nAnswer 2: The movie 'Citizen Kane' is available on the following streaming platforms:\n- HBO Max: [Watch on HBO Max](https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXduU_gwwz-NvjAEAAAAC)\n- Amazon Prime Video: [Watch on Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Kane-Orson-Welles/dp/B000I9YLWG)\n- AppleTV+: [Watch on AppleTV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/citizen-kane/umc.cmc.21zj0v11gnqbbqrebieh0vpk7)\n- Disney+: Available on Disney+\n- Netflix: Available on Netflix\nAnswer Status: Unsolved\nReason: The answer only addressed the first and second part of the query by providing the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' but did not provide information about the cast or a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US. The response was incomplete and did not fully address the query.\n\nQuery: \nI need to ensure that the email 'jenny.smith@yahoo.com' exists.

You need to output \"Unsolved\" or \"Solved\" and your reason. You must obey the following rules:\n\nYou should response \"Solved\" when:\n    1. If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3. Severe Factual Error:\n        \u2022   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n    1. VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide the runtime and IMDb ratings for these movies.\nAnswer 1: Here are some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US:\n\n1. Knives Out\n   - Runtime: 130 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 7.9/10\n   - Available on: Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video\n\n2. Jumanji: The Next Level\n   - Runtime: 110 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 6.7/10\n   - Available on: Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix\n\nPlease note that availability may vary depending on your location and streaming platform subscriptions. Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project. Can you help me find a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide me with the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' and the basic information about the cast, including their names and professions.\nAnswer 2: The movie 'Citizen Kane' is available on the following streaming platforms:\n- HBO Max: [Watch on HBO Max](https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXduU_gwwz-NvjAEAAAAC)\n- Amazon Prime Video: [Watch on Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Kane-Orson-Welles/dp/B000I9YLWG)\n- AppleTV+: [Watch on AppleTV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/citizen-kane/umc.cmc.21zj0v11gnqbbqrebieh0vpk7)\n- Disney+: Available on Disney+\n- Netflix: Available on Netflix\nAnswer Status: Unsolved\nReason: The answer only addressed the first and second part of the query by providing the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' but did not provide information about the cast or a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US. The response was incomplete and did not fully address the query.\n\nQuery: \nI'm a music lover and I want to download all the tracks from the album with the ID 6lggWd5q9Rh66OkDE1eNDr. Can you provide me with the track list, including the title, artists, and cover?

If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3.

DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film.

Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project.

You need to output \"Unsolved\" or \"Solved\" and your reason. You must obey the following rules:\n\nYou should response \"Solved\" when:\n    1. If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3.

DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film.

Knives Out\n   - Runtime: 130 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 7.9/10\n   - Available on: Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video\n\n2. Jumanji: The Next Level\n   - Runtime: 110 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 6.7/10\n   - Available on: Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix\n\nPlease note that availability may vary depending on your location and streaming platform subscriptions. Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project. Can you help me find a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide me with the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' and the basic information about the cast, including their names and professions.\nAnswer 2: The movie 'Citizen Kane' is available on the following streaming platforms:\n- HBO Max: [Watch on HBO Max](https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXduU_gwwz-NvjAEAAAAC)\n- Amazon Prime Video: [Watch on Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Kane-Orson-Welles/dp/B000I9YLWG)\n- AppleTV+: [Watch on AppleTV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/citizen-kane/umc.cmc.21zj0v11gnqbbqrebieh0vpk7)\n- Disney+: Available on Disney+\n- Netflix: Available on Netflix\nAnswer Status: Unsolved\nReason: The answer only addressed the first and second part of the query by providing the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' but did not provide information about the cast or a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US. The response was incomplete and did not fully address the query.\n\nQuery: \nI'm redecorating my living room and I'm in need of some color ideas. Can you generate a random set of colors for the room?

If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3.

Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film.

This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3. Severe Factual Error:\n        \u2022   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n    1. VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film.

DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide the runtime and IMDb ratings for these movies.\nAnswer 1: Here are some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US:\n\n1. Knives Out\n   - Runtime: 130 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 7.9/10\n   - Available on: Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video\n\n2. Jumanji: The Next Level\n   - Runtime: 110 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 6.7/10\n   - Available on: Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix\n\nPlease note that availability may vary depending on your location and streaming platform subscriptions. Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project. Can you help me find a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide me with the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' and the basic information about the cast, including their names and professions.\nAnswer 2: The movie 'Citizen Kane' is available on the following streaming platforms:\n- HBO Max: [Watch on HBO Max](https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXduU_gwwz-NvjAEAAAAC)\n- Amazon Prime Video: [Watch on Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Kane-Orson-Welles/dp/B000I9YLWG)\n- AppleTV+: [Watch on AppleTV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/citizen-kane/umc.cmc.21zj0v11gnqbbqrebieh0vpk7)\n- Disney+: Available on Disney+\n- Netflix: Available on Netflix\nAnswer Status: Unsolved\nReason: The answer only addressed the first and second part of the query by providing the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' but did not provide information about the cast or a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US. The response was incomplete and did not fully address the query.\n\nQuery: \nI'm helping my friend choose a new mobile phone and I need to compare the specifications of different phone brands. Can you give me a list of all the phone brands available in your database? Furthermore, I would like to see the models offered by the brand 'Samsung'.\nAnswer: \nno answer\n\nNow give your reason and answer status in the following format:\n\nAnswer Status\nxxx (can only be \"Solved\" or \"Unsolved\")\nReason\nxxx\n"

VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide the runtime and IMDb ratings for these movies.\nAnswer 1: Here are some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US:\n\n1.

Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project. Can you help me find a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide me with the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' and the basic information about the cast, including their names and professions.\nAnswer 2: The movie 'Citizen Kane' is available on the following streaming platforms:\n- HBO Max: [Watch on HBO Max](https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXduU_gwwz-NvjAEAAAAC)\n- Amazon Prime Video: [Watch on Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Kane-Orson-Welles/dp/B000I9YLWG)\n- AppleTV+: [Watch on AppleTV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/citizen-kane/umc.cmc.21zj0v11gnqbbqrebieh0vpk7)\n- Disney+: Available on Disney+\n- Netflix: Available on Netflix\nAnswer Status: Unsolved\nReason: The answer only addressed the first and second part of the query by providing the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' but did not provide information about the cast or a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US. The response was incomplete and did not fully address the query.\n\nQuery: \nI'm creating a secure login system for my website and I want to implement captchas. Can you provide an API that generates captchas and verifies if they are entered correctly? It would be helpful if the API can return a message confirming the verification.\nAnswer: \nCaptcha verified successfully.\n\nNow give your reason and answer status in the following format:\n\nAnswer Status\nxxx (can only be \"Solved\" or \"Unsolved\")\nReason\nxxx\n"

If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3.

You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film.

You need to output \"Unsolved\" or \"Solved\" and your reason. You must obey the following rules:\n\nYou should response \"Solved\" when:\n    1. If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3.

DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US?

Knives Out\n   - Runtime: 130 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 7.9/10\n   - Available on: Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video\n\n2. Jumanji: The Next Level\n   - Runtime: 110 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 6.7/10\n   - Available on: Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix\n\nPlease note that availability may vary depending on your location and streaming platform subscriptions. Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project. Can you help me find a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide me with the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' and the basic information about the cast, including their names and professions.\nAnswer 2: The movie 'Citizen Kane' is available on the following streaming platforms:\n- HBO Max: [Watch on HBO Max](https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXduU_gwwz-NvjAEAAAAC)\n- Amazon Prime Video: [Watch on Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Kane-Orson-Welles/dp/B000I9YLWG)\n- AppleTV+: [Watch on AppleTV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/citizen-kane/umc.cmc.21zj0v11gnqbbqrebieh0vpk7)\n- Disney+: Available on Disney+\n- Netflix: Available on Netflix\nAnswer Status: Unsolved\nReason: The answer only addressed the first and second part of the query by providing the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' but did not provide information about the cast or a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US.

If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3.

You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film.

The reasoning process and function calling are enclosed within <think> </think> and <tool_call> </tool_call> tags. The results of the function calls will be given back to you after execution, and you can continue to call functions until you get the final answer for the user's question. Finally, if you have got the answer, enclose it within \\boxed{} with latex format and do not continue to call functions, i.e., <think> Based on the response from the function call, I get the weather information. </think> The weather in Beijing on 2025-04-01 is \\[ \\boxed{20C} \\].\n\nFor each function call, return a json object with function name and arguments within <tool_call></tool_call> XML tags:\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": <function-name>, \"arguments\": <args-json-object>}\n</tool_call><|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nI am a movie critic and I need to gather information about multiple movies.

The reasoning process and function calling are enclosed within <think> </think> and <tool_call> </tool_call> tags. The results of the function calls will be given back to you after execution, and you can continue to call functions until you get the final answer for the user's question.

You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film.

This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3. Severe Factual Error:\n        \u2022   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n    1. VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide the runtime and IMDb ratings for these movies.\nAnswer 1: Here are some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US:\n\n1. Knives Out\n   - Runtime: 130 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 7.9/10\n   - Available on: Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video\n\n2. Jumanji: The Next Level\n   - Runtime: 110 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 6.7/10\n   - Available on: Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix\n\nPlease note that availability may vary depending on your location and streaming platform subscriptions. Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project. Can you help me find a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide me with the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' and the basic information about the cast, including their names and professions.\nAnswer 2: The movie 'Citizen Kane' is available on the following streaming platforms:\n- HBO Max: [Watch on HBO Max](https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXduU_gwwz-NvjAEAAAAC)\n- Amazon Prime Video: [Watch on Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Kane-Orson-Welles/dp/B000I9YLWG)\n- AppleTV+: [Watch on AppleTV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/citizen-kane/umc.cmc.21zj0v11gnqbbqrebieh0vpk7)\n- Disney+: Available on Disney+\n- Netflix: Available on Netflix\nAnswer Status: Unsolved\nReason: The answer only addressed the first and second part of the query by providing the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' but did not provide information about the cast or a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US. The response was incomplete and did not fully address the query.\n\nQuery: \nI need to generate 50 unique GUIDs for my company's new project. Can you help me with that? Also, provide the default batch size for generating GUIDs.\nAnswer: \nGUIDs: ['550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000', '550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001', ..., '550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440049'], Default Batch Size: 10\n\nNow give your reason and answer status in the following format:\n\nAnswer Status\nxxx (can only be \"Solved\" or \"Unsolved\")\nReason\nxxx\n"

If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3.

Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film.

Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project.

If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query.

You need to output \"Unsolved\" or \"Solved\" and your reason. You must obey the following rules:\n\nYou should response \"Solved\" when:\n    1. If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3. Severe Factual Error:\n        \u2022   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n    1.

DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US?

Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings.

The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3. Severe Factual Error:\n        \u2022   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n    1. VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide the runtime and IMDb ratings for these movies.\nAnswer 1: Here are some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US:\n\n1. Knives Out\n   - Runtime: 130 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 7.9/10\n   - Available on: Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video\n\n2. Jumanji: The Next Level\n   - Runtime: 110 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 6.7/10\n   - Available on: Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix\n\nPlease note that availability may vary depending on your location and streaming platform subscriptions. Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project. Can you help me find a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide me with the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' and the basic information about the cast, including their names and professions.\nAnswer 2: The movie 'Citizen Kane' is available on the following streaming platforms:\n- HBO Max: [Watch on HBO Max](https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXduU_gwwz-NvjAEAAAAC)\n- Amazon Prime Video: [Watch on Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Kane-Orson-Welles/dp/B000I9YLWG)\n- AppleTV+: [Watch on AppleTV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/citizen-kane/umc.cmc.21zj0v11gnqbbqrebieh0vpk7)\n- Disney+: Available on Disney+\n- Netflix: Available on Netflix\nAnswer Status: Unsolved\nReason: The answer only addressed the first and second part of the query by providing the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' but did not provide information about the cast or a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US. The response was incomplete and did not fully address the query.\n\nQuery: \nI am a graphic designer and I want to explore the templates available in my Nexweave account. Can you provide me with the details of all the templates? Also, give me the campaign details for the campaign with the ID 'lmn321'.\nAnswer: \nTemplates: [{'name': 'Template 1', 'description': 'This is Template 1', 'variables': ['variable1', 'variable2']}, {'name': 'Template 2', 'description': 'This is Template 2', 'variables': ['variable3', 'variable4']}], Campaign Details: []\n\nNow give your reason and answer status in the following format:\n\nAnswer Status\nxxx (can only be \"Solved\" or \"Unsolved\")\nReason\nxxx\n"

If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3.

VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film.

Knives Out\n   - Runtime: 130 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 7.9/10\n   - Available on: Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video\n\n2. Jumanji: The Next Level\n   - Runtime: 110 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 6.7/10\n   - Available on: Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix\n\nPlease note that availability may vary depending on your location and streaming platform subscriptions. Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project. Can you help me find a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide me with the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' and the basic information about the cast, including their names and professions.\nAnswer 2: The movie 'Citizen Kane' is available on the following streaming platforms:\n- HBO Max: [Watch on HBO Max](https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXduU_gwwz-NvjAEAAAAC)\n- Amazon Prime Video: [Watch on Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Kane-Orson-Welles/dp/B000I9YLWG)\n- AppleTV+: [Watch on AppleTV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/citizen-kane/umc.cmc.21zj0v11gnqbbqrebieh0vpk7)\n- Disney+: Available on Disney+\n- Netflix: Available on Netflix\nAnswer Status: Unsolved\nReason: The answer only addressed the first and second part of the query by providing the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' but did not provide information about the cast or a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US. The response was incomplete and did not fully address the query.\n\nQuery: \nI'm organizing a company event and I want to showcase some popular videos.

The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3. Severe Factual Error:\n        \u2022   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n    1. VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide the runtime and IMDb ratings for these movies.\nAnswer 1: Here are some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US:\n\n1. Knives Out\n   - Runtime: 130 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 7.9/10\n   - Available on: Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video\n\n2. Jumanji: The Next Level\n   - Runtime: 110 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 6.7/10\n   - Available on: Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix\n\nPlease note that availability may vary depending on your location and streaming platform subscriptions. Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project. Can you help me find a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide me with the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' and the basic information about the cast, including their names and professions.\nAnswer 2: The movie 'Citizen Kane' is available on the following streaming platforms:\n- HBO Max: [Watch on HBO Max](https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXduU_gwwz-NvjAEAAAAC)\n- Amazon Prime Video: [Watch on Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Kane-Orson-Welles/dp/B000I9YLWG)\n- AppleTV+: [Watch on AppleTV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/citizen-kane/umc.cmc.21zj0v11gnqbbqrebieh0vpk7)\n- Disney+: Available on Disney+\n- Netflix: Available on Netflix\nAnswer Status: Unsolved\nReason: The answer only addressed the first and second part of the query by providing the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' but did not provide information about the cast or a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US. The response was incomplete and did not fully address the query.\n\nQuery: \nMy friend is organizing a virtual event and wants to share the event details using a QR code. Can you help generate a QR code image for the event information? The event details can be provided as a string.\nAnswer: \nQR Code Image Generated\n\nNow give your reason and answer status in the following format:\n\nAnswer Status\nxxx (can only be \"Solved\" or \"Unsolved\")\nReason\nxxx\n"

However, since one part of the query was not addressed, the answer is considered \"Unsolved.\"",
        "llm_judge_prompt": "\nGiven a query and an answer provided by an AI agent, you now need to determine the answer_status of whether the well solved the query, i.e. whether the need of the query is satisfied. You need to output \"Unsolved\" or \"Solved\" and your reason. You must obey the following rules:\n\nYou should response \"Solved\" when:\n    1. If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3.

DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide the runtime and IMDb ratings for these movies.\nAnswer 1: Here are some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US:\n\n1.

        "llm_judge_prompt": "\nGiven a query and an answer provided by an AI agent, you now need to determine the answer_status of whether the well solved the query, i.e. whether the need of the query is satisfied. You need to output \"Unsolved\" or \"Solved\" and your reason. You must obey the following rules:\n\nYou should response \"Solved\" when:\n    1. If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3. Severe Factual Error:\n        \u2022   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n    1. VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide the runtime and IMDb ratings for these movies.\nAnswer 1: Here are some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US:\n\n1. Knives Out\n   - Runtime: 130 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 7.9/10\n   - Available on: Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video\n\n2. Jumanji: The Next Level\n   - Runtime: 110 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 6.7/10\n   - Available on: Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix\n\nPlease note that availability may vary depending on your location and streaming platform subscriptions. Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project. Can you help me find a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide me with the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' and the basic information about the cast, including their names and professions.\nAnswer 2: The movie 'Citizen Kane' is available on the following streaming platforms:\n- HBO Max: [Watch on HBO Max](https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXduU_gwwz-NvjAEAAAAC)\n- Amazon Prime Video: [Watch on Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Kane-Orson-Welles/dp/B000I9YLWG)\n- AppleTV+: [Watch on AppleTV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/citizen-kane/umc.cmc.21zj0v11gnqbbqrebieh0vpk7)\n- Disney+: Available on Disney+\n- Netflix: Available on Netflix\nAnswer Status: Unsolved\nReason: The answer only addressed the first and second part of the query by providing the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' but did not provide information about the cast or a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US. The response was incomplete and did not fully address the query.\n\nQuery: \nI'm a movie critic and I need to write reviews for the latest movies. Can you provide me with a list of new arrivals on different platforms? It would be great if you could include the streaming platforms and the genres for each movie.\nAnswer: \n[]\n\nNow give your reason and answer status in the following format:\n\nAnswer Status\nxxx (can only be \"Solved\" or \"Unsolved\")\nReason\nxxx\n"

You need to output \"Unsolved\" or \"Solved\" and your reason. You must obey the following rules:\n\nYou should response \"Solved\" when:\n    1. If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3.

Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project. Can you help me find a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide me with the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' and the basic information about the cast, including their names and professions.\nAnswer 2: The movie 'Citizen Kane' is available on the following streaming platforms:\n- HBO Max: [Watch on HBO Max](https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXduU_gwwz-NvjAEAAAAC)\n- Amazon Prime Video: [Watch on Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Kane-Orson-Welles/dp/B000I9YLWG)\n- AppleTV+: [Watch on AppleTV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/citizen-kane/umc.cmc.21zj0v11gnqbbqrebieh0vpk7)\n- Disney+: Available on Disney+\n- Netflix: Available on Netflix\nAnswer Status: Unsolved\nReason: The answer only addressed the first and second part of the query by providing the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' but did not provide information about the cast or a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US.

        "llm_judge_prompt": "\nGiven a query and an answer provided by an AI agent, you now need to determine the answer_status of whether the well solved the query, i.e. whether the need of the query is satisfied. You need to output \"Unsolved\" or \"Solved\" and your reason. You must obey the following rules:\n\nYou should response \"Solved\" when:\n    1. If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3. Severe Factual Error:\n        \u2022   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n    1. VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide the runtime and IMDb ratings for these movies.\nAnswer 1: Here are some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US:\n\n1. Knives Out\n   - Runtime: 130 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 7.9/10\n   - Available on: Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video\n\n2. Jumanji: The Next Level\n   - Runtime: 110 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 6.7/10\n   - Available on: Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix\n\nPlease note that availability may vary depending on your location and streaming platform subscriptions. Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project. Can you help me find a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide me with the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' and the basic information about the cast, including their names and professions.\nAnswer 2: The movie 'Citizen Kane' is available on the following streaming platforms:\n- HBO Max: [Watch on HBO Max](https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXduU_gwwz-NvjAEAAAAC)\n- Amazon Prime Video: [Watch on Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Kane-Orson-Welles/dp/B000I9YLWG)\n- AppleTV+: [Watch on AppleTV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/citizen-kane/umc.cmc.21zj0v11gnqbbqrebieh0vpk7)\n- Disney+: Available on Disney+\n- Netflix: Available on Netflix\nAnswer Status: Unsolved\nReason: The answer only addressed the first and second part of the query by providing the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' but did not provide information about the cast or a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US. The response was incomplete and did not fully address the query.\n\nQuery: \nI'm looking for a random string of 70 characters. Could you also generate 150 UUIDs with dashes? Thank you!\nAnswer: \nno answer\n\nNow give your reason and answer status in the following format:\n\nAnswer Status\nxxx (can only be \"Solved\" or \"Unsolved\")\nReason\nxxx\n"

If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3.

Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film.

Also, provide the runtime and IMDb ratings for these movies.\nAnswer 1: Here are some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US:\n\n1. Knives Out\n   - Runtime: 130 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 7.9/10\n   - Available on: Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video\n\n2. Jumanji: The Next Level\n   - Runtime: 110 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 6.7/10\n   - Available on: Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix\n\nPlease note that availability may vary depending on your location and streaming platform subscriptions. Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project.

Also, provide me with the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' and the basic information about the cast, including their names and professions.\nAnswer 2: The movie 'Citizen Kane' is available on the following streaming platforms:\n- HBO Max: [Watch on HBO Max](https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXduU_gwwz-NvjAEAAAAC)\n- Amazon Prime Video: [Watch on Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Kane-Orson-Welles/dp/B000I9YLWG)\n- AppleTV+: [Watch on AppleTV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/citizen-kane/umc.cmc.21zj0v11gnqbbqrebieh0vpk7)\n- Disney+: Available on Disney+\n- Netflix: Available on Netflix\nAnswer Status: Unsolved\nReason: The answer only addressed the first and second part of the query by providing the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' but did not provide information about the cast or a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US. The response was incomplete and did not fully address the query.\n\nQuery: \nI'm concerned about a phone number that has been calling me several times. Can you help me identify the caller?

If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3.

Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film.

        "llm_judge_prompt": "\nGiven a query and an answer provided by an AI agent, you now need to determine the answer_status of whether the well solved the query, i.e. whether the need of the query is satisfied. You need to output \"Unsolved\" or \"Solved\" and your reason. You must obey the following rules:\n\nYou should response \"Solved\" when:\n    1. If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3. Severe Factual Error:\n        \u2022   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n    1. VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide the runtime and IMDb ratings for these movies.\nAnswer 1: Here are some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US:\n\n1. Knives Out\n   - Runtime: 130 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 7.9/10\n   - Available on: Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video\n\n2. Jumanji: The Next Level\n   - Runtime: 110 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 6.7/10\n   - Available on: Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix\n\nPlease note that availability may vary depending on your location and streaming platform subscriptions. Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project. Can you help me find a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide me with the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' and the basic information about the cast, including their names and professions.\nAnswer 2: The movie 'Citizen Kane' is available on the following streaming platforms:\n- HBO Max: [Watch on HBO Max](https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXduU_gwwz-NvjAEAAAAC)\n- Amazon Prime Video: [Watch on Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Kane-Orson-Welles/dp/B000I9YLWG)\n- AppleTV+: [Watch on AppleTV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/citizen-kane/umc.cmc.21zj0v11gnqbbqrebieh0vpk7)\n- Disney+: Available on Disney+\n- Netflix: Available on Netflix\nAnswer Status: Unsolved\nReason: The answer only addressed the first and second part of the query by providing the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' but did not provide information about the cast or a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US. The response was incomplete and did not fully address the query.\n\nQuery: \nI'm planning a surprise birthday party for my friend and I want to create personalized QR codes for the invitations. Can you generate QR codes as base64 images with individual labels for each guest? It would be great if the QR codes could be customized with different foreground and background colors.\nAnswer: \nQR Code for Alice: <base64_encoded_data>, QR Code for Bob: <base64_encoded_data>\n\nNow give your reason and answer status in the following format:\n\nAnswer Status\nxxx (can only be \"Solved\" or \"Unsolved\")\nReason\nxxx\n"

        "llm_judge_prompt": "\nGiven a query and an answer provided by an AI agent, you now need to determine the answer_status of whether the well solved the query, i.e. whether the need of the query is satisfied. You need to output \"Unsolved\" or \"Solved\" and your reason. You must obey the following rules:\n\nYou should response \"Solved\" when:\n    1. If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3.

DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US?

Knives Out\n   - Runtime: 130 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 7.9/10\n   - Available on: Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video\n\n2. Jumanji: The Next Level\n   - Runtime: 110 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 6.7/10\n   - Available on: Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix\n\nPlease note that availability may vary depending on your location and streaming platform subscriptions. Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project. Can you help me find a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide me with the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' and the basic information about the cast, including their names and professions.\nAnswer 2: The movie 'Citizen Kane' is available on the following streaming platforms:\n- HBO Max: [Watch on HBO Max](https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXduU_gwwz-NvjAEAAAAC)\n- Amazon Prime Video: [Watch on Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Kane-Orson-Welles/dp/B000I9YLWG)\n- AppleTV+: [Watch on AppleTV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/citizen-kane/umc.cmc.21zj0v11gnqbbqrebieh0vpk7)\n- Disney+: Available on Disney+\n- Netflix: Available on Netflix\nAnswer Status: Unsolved\nReason: The answer only addressed the first and second part of the query by providing the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' but did not provide information about the cast or a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US. The response was incomplete and did not fully address the query.\n\nQuery: \nI need to send a text to the text-to-speech API and get the speech output in English. Can you help me with this task?

The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3. Severe Factual Error:\n        \u2022   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n    1. VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide the runtime and IMDb ratings for these movies.\nAnswer 1: Here are some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US:\n\n1. Knives Out\n   - Runtime: 130 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 7.9/10\n   - Available on: Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video\n\n2. Jumanji: The Next Level\n   - Runtime: 110 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 6.7/10\n   - Available on: Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix\n\nPlease note that availability may vary depending on your location and streaming platform subscriptions. Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project. Can you help me find a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide me with the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' and the basic information about the cast, including their names and professions.\nAnswer 2: The movie 'Citizen Kane' is available on the following streaming platforms:\n- HBO Max: [Watch on HBO Max](https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXduU_gwwz-NvjAEAAAAC)\n- Amazon Prime Video: [Watch on Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Kane-Orson-Welles/dp/B000I9YLWG)\n- AppleTV+: [Watch on AppleTV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/citizen-kane/umc.cmc.21zj0v11gnqbbqrebieh0vpk7)\n- Disney+: Available on Disney+\n- Netflix: Available on Netflix\nAnswer Status: Unsolved\nReason: The answer only addressed the first and second part of the query by providing the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' but did not provide information about the cast or a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US. The response was incomplete and did not fully address the query.\n\nQuery: \nI'm organizing a conference and I need your help. I have a list of attendees with their phone numbers. I want to convert these numbers into words. Can you convert the number 123456789 into words? Also, can you convert the text 'Welcome to the conference' into speech using the English language?\nAnswer: \none hundred and twenty-three million, four hundred and fifty-six thousand, seven hundred and eighty-ninth, Welcome to the conference (speech version)\n\nNow give your reason and answer status in the following format:\n\nAnswer Status\nxxx (can only be \"Solved\" or \"Unsolved\")\nReason\nxxx\n"

        "llm_judge_prompt": "\nGiven a query and an answer provided by an AI agent, you now need to determine the answer_status of whether the well solved the query, i.e. whether the need of the query is satisfied. You need to output \"Unsolved\" or \"Solved\" and your reason. You must obey the following rules:\n\nYou should response \"Solved\" when:\n    1. If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3. Severe Factual Error:\n        \u2022   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n    1. VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide the runtime and IMDb ratings for these movies.\nAnswer 1: Here are some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US:\n\n1.

Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project.

The response was incomplete and did not fully address the query.\n\nQuery: \nI'm curious about the supported carriers for international shipping. Can you provide me with the list? Also, I want to track a package with the tracking number NY323068698GB. Can you give me the tracking information?\nAnswer: \nCarriers: DHL, FedEx, UPS, TNT, others. Tracking Information: Shipped from London, in transit, expected to arrive in 3 days.\n\nNow give your reason and answer status in the following format:\n\nAnswer Status\nxxx (can only be \"Solved\" or \"Unsolved\")\nReason\nxxx\n"

You need to output \"Unsolved\" or \"Solved\" and your reason. You must obey the following rules:\n\nYou should response \"Solved\" when:\n    1. If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3. Severe Factual Error:\n        \u2022   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n    1. VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide the runtime and IMDb ratings for these movies.\nAnswer 1: Here are some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US:\n\n1. Knives Out\n   - Runtime: 130 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 7.9/10\n   - Available on: Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video\n\n2. Jumanji: The Next Level\n   - Runtime: 110 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 6.7/10\n   - Available on: Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix\n\nPlease note that availability may vary depending on your location and streaming platform subscriptions. Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project. Can you help me find a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide me with the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' and the basic information about the cast, including their names and professions.\nAnswer 2: The movie 'Citizen Kane' is available on the following streaming platforms:\n- HBO Max: [Watch on HBO Max](https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXduU_gwwz-NvjAEAAAAC)\n- Amazon Prime Video: [Watch on Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Kane-Orson-Welles/dp/B000I9YLWG)\n- AppleTV+: [Watch on AppleTV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/citizen-kane/umc.cmc.21zj0v11gnqbbqrebieh0vpk7)\n- Disney+: Available on Disney+\n- Netflix: Available on Netflix\nAnswer Status: Unsolved\nReason: The answer only addressed the first and second part of the query by providing the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' but did not provide information about the cast or a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US. The response was incomplete and did not fully address the query.\n\nQuery: \nI want to track user engagement for a specific session identified by the sessionId parameter using the GET_analytics-sessions-sessionId-events API. Can you provide me with the events related to that session? Additionally, I'm interested in retrieving the details of a specific player identified by the playerId parameter using the GET_players-playerId API.\nAnswer: \nEvents for session sessionId: [], Player details: {'playerId': 'playerId', 'playerStatus': 'active', 'playerType': 'on-demand', 'playerVersion': '3.1.1'}\n\nNow give your reason and answer status in the following format:\n\nAnswer Status\nxxx (can only be \"Solved\" or \"Unsolved\")\nReason\nxxx\n"

        "llm_judge_prompt": "\nGiven a query and an answer provided by an AI agent, you now need to determine the answer_status of whether the well solved the query, i.e. whether the need of the query is satisfied. You need to output \"Unsolved\" or \"Solved\" and your reason. You must obey the following rules:\n\nYou should response \"Solved\" when:\n    1. If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3. Severe Factual Error:\n        \u2022   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n    1. VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide the runtime and IMDb ratings for these movies.\nAnswer 1: Here are some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US:\n\n1. Knives Out\n   - Runtime: 130 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 7.9/10\n   - Available on: Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video\n\n2.

Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project.

If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3.

You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film.

        "llm_judge_prompt": "\nGiven a query and an answer provided by an AI agent, you now need to determine the answer_status of whether the well solved the query, i.e. whether the need of the query is satisfied. You need to output \"Unsolved\" or \"Solved\" and your reason. You must obey the following rules:\n\nYou should response \"Solved\" when:\n    1. If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3. Severe Factual Error:\n        \u2022   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n    1. VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide the runtime and IMDb ratings for these movies.\nAnswer 1: Here are some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US:\n\n1. Knives Out\n   - Runtime: 130 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 7.9/10\n   - Available on: Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video\n\n2. Jumanji: The Next Level\n   - Runtime: 110 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 6.7/10\n   - Available on: Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix\n\nPlease note that availability may vary depending on your location and streaming platform subscriptions. Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project. Can you help me find a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide me with the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' and the basic information about the cast, including their names and professions.\nAnswer 2: The movie 'Citizen Kane' is available on the following streaming platforms:\n- HBO Max: [Watch on HBO Max](https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXduU_gwwz-NvjAEAAAAC)\n- Amazon Prime Video: [Watch on Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Kane-Orson-Welles/dp/B000I9YLWG)\n- AppleTV+: [Watch on AppleTV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/citizen-kane/umc.cmc.21zj0v11gnqbbqrebieh0vpk7)\n- Disney+: Available on Disney+\n- Netflix: Available on Netflix\nAnswer Status: Unsolved\nReason: The answer only addressed the first and second part of the query by providing the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' but did not provide information about the cast or a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US. The response was incomplete and did not fully address the query.\n\nQuery: \nI want to ensure that my company's email addresses are correctly formatted and exist. Please validate the format and existence of 'info@company.com' and 'support@company.com'.\nAnswer: \ninfo@company.com: exists, support@company.com: exists\n\nNow give your reason and answer status in the following format:\n\nAnswer Status\nxxx (can only be \"Solved\" or \"Unsolved\")\nReason\nxxx\n"

The reasoning process and function calling are enclosed within <think> </think> and <tool_call> </tool_call> tags. The results of the function calls will be given back to you after execution, and you can continue to call functions until you get the final answer for the user's question. Finally, if you have got the answer, enclose it within \\boxed{} with latex format and do not continue to call functions, i.e., <think> Based on the response from the function call, I get the weather information. </think> The weather in Beijing on 2025-04-01 is \\[ \\boxed{20C} \\].\n\nFor each function call, return a json object with function name and arguments within <tool_call></tool_call> XML tags:\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": <function-name>, \"arguments\": <args-json-object>}\n</tool_call><|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nI am analyzing the properties of frames in an image.

        "llm_judge_prompt": "\nGiven a query and an answer provided by an AI agent, you now need to determine the answer_status of whether the well solved the query, i.e. whether the need of the query is satisfied. You need to output \"Unsolved\" or \"Solved\" and your reason. You must obey the following rules:\n\nYou should response \"Solved\" when:\n    1. If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3. Severe Factual Error:\n        \u2022   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n    1. VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide the runtime and IMDb ratings for these movies.\nAnswer 1: Here are some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US:\n\n1.

Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project. Can you help me find a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide me with the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' and the basic information about the cast, including their names and professions.\nAnswer 2: The movie 'Citizen Kane' is available on the following streaming platforms:\n- HBO Max: [Watch on HBO Max](https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXduU_gwwz-NvjAEAAAAC)\n- Amazon Prime Video: [Watch on Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Kane-Orson-Welles/dp/B000I9YLWG)\n- AppleTV+: [Watch on AppleTV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/citizen-kane/umc.cmc.21zj0v11gnqbbqrebieh0vpk7)\n- Disney+: Available on Disney+\n- Netflix: Available on Netflix\nAnswer Status: Unsolved\nReason: The answer only addressed the first and second part of the query by providing the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' but did not provide information about the cast or a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US. The response was incomplete and did not fully address the query.\n\nQuery: \nI am analyzing the properties of frames in an image. Can you guide me on how to use the API call to get the properties of frame 2 in an image named 'image5.bmp'? Also, please ensure that the image is stored in the 'frames' folder in my Aspose Cloud storage.\nAnswer: \nFrame 2 Properties: Dimensions - 800x600 pixels, Resolution - 72 DPI, Color Depth - 24 bits, Color Space - RGB, Supports Transparency, Format - Supported by most image viewers\n\nNow give your reason and answer status in the following format:\n\nAnswer Status\nxxx (can only be \"Solved\" or \"Unsolved\")\nReason\nxxx\n"

You need to output \"Unsolved\" or \"Solved\" and your reason. You must obey the following rules:\n\nYou should response \"Solved\" when:\n    1. If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3. Severe Factual Error:\n        \u2022   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n    1. VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide the runtime and IMDb ratings for these movies.\nAnswer 1: Here are some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US:\n\n1. Knives Out\n   - Runtime: 130 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 7.9/10\n   - Available on: Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video\n\n2. Jumanji: The Next Level\n   - Runtime: 110 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 6.7/10\n   - Available on: Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix\n\nPlease note that availability may vary depending on your location and streaming platform subscriptions. Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project. Can you help me find a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide me with the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' and the basic information about the cast, including their names and professions.\nAnswer 2: The movie 'Citizen Kane' is available on the following streaming platforms:\n- HBO Max: [Watch on HBO Max](https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXduU_gwwz-NvjAEAAAAC)\n- Amazon Prime Video: [Watch on Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Kane-Orson-Welles/dp/B000I9YLWG)\n- AppleTV+: [Watch on AppleTV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/citizen-kane/umc.cmc.21zj0v11gnqbbqrebieh0vpk7)\n- Disney+: Available on Disney+\n- Netflix: Available on Netflix\nAnswer Status: Unsolved\nReason: The answer only addressed the first and second part of the query by providing the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' but did not provide information about the cast or a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US.

If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3. Severe Factual Error:\n        \u2022   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n    1. VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film.

Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide the runtime and IMDb ratings for these movies.\nAnswer 1: Here are some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US:\n\n1. Knives Out\n   - Runtime: 130 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 7.9/10\n   - Available on: Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video\n\n2. Jumanji: The Next Level\n   - Runtime: 110 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 6.7/10\n   - Available on: Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix\n\nPlease note that availability may vary depending on your location and streaming platform subscriptions. Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project. Can you help me find a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide me with the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' and the basic information about the cast, including their names and professions.\nAnswer 2: The movie 'Citizen Kane' is available on the following streaming platforms:\n- HBO Max: [Watch on HBO Max](https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXduU_gwwz-NvjAEAAAAC)\n- Amazon Prime Video: [Watch on Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Kane-Orson-Welles/dp/B000I9YLWG)\n- AppleTV+: [Watch on AppleTV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/citizen-kane/umc.cmc.21zj0v11gnqbbqrebieh0vpk7)\n- Disney+: Available on Disney+\n- Netflix: Available on Netflix\nAnswer Status: Unsolved\nReason: The answer only addressed the first and second part of the query by providing the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' but did not provide information about the cast or a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US. The response was incomplete and did not fully address the query.\n\nQuery: \nI want to track a package with the tracking number NY323068698GB. Can you provide me with the tracking information? Additionally, I need to know the carrier for another package with the tracking number YT2003521266065328. Can you detect the carrier for me?\nAnswer: \nTracking Information: [Event: Dispatched, Location: London, Timestamp: 2023-09-15 10:00:00], Carrier: YunExpress\n\nNow give your reason and answer status in the following format:\n\nAnswer Status\nxxx (can only be \"Solved\" or \"Unsolved\")\nReason\nxxx\n"

        "llm_judge_prompt": "\nGiven a query and an answer provided by an AI agent, you now need to determine the answer_status of whether the well solved the query, i.e. whether the need of the query is satisfied. You need to output \"Unsolved\" or \"Solved\" and your reason. You must obey the following rules:\n\nYou should response \"Solved\" when:\n    1. If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3. Severe Factual Error:\n        \u2022   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n    1. VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide the runtime and IMDb ratings for these movies.\nAnswer 1: Here are some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US:\n\n1.

Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings.

to get the information or perform the actions if needed. The reasoning process and function calling are enclosed within <think> </think> and <tool_call> </tool_call> tags. The results of the function calls will be given back to you after execution, and you can continue to call functions until you get the final answer for the user's question. Finally, if you have got the answer, enclose it within \\boxed{} with latex format and do not continue to call functions, i.e., <think> Based on the response from the function call, I get the weather information. </think> The weather in Beijing on 2025-04-01 is \\[ \\boxed{20C} \\].\n\nFor each function call, return a json object with function name and arguments within <tool_call></tool_call> XML tags:\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": <function-name>, \"arguments\": <args-json-object>}\n</tool_call><|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nConvert the hex color code 'ffffff' to HSL.

You need to output \"Unsolved\" or \"Solved\" and your reason. You must obey the following rules:\n\nYou should response \"Solved\" when:\n    1. If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3.

DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film.

If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3.

Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film.

If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3.

Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film.

VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US?

        "llm_judge_prompt": "\nGiven a query and an answer provided by an AI agent, you now need to determine the answer_status of whether the well solved the query, i.e. whether the need of the query is satisfied. You need to output \"Unsolved\" or \"Solved\" and your reason. You must obey the following rules:\n\nYou should response \"Solved\" when:\n    1. If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3. Severe Factual Error:\n        \u2022   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n    1. VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide the runtime and IMDb ratings for these movies.\nAnswer 1: Here are some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US:\n\n1.

Jumanji: The Next Level\n   - Runtime: 110 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 6.7/10\n   - Available on: Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix\n\nPlease note that availability may vary depending on your location and streaming platform subscriptions. Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project. Can you help me find a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide me with the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' and the basic information about the cast, including their names and professions.\nAnswer 2: The movie 'Citizen Kane' is available on the following streaming platforms:\n- HBO Max: [Watch on HBO Max](https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXduU_gwwz-NvjAEAAAAC)\n- Amazon Prime Video: [Watch on Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Kane-Orson-Welles/dp/B000I9YLWG)\n- AppleTV+: [Watch on AppleTV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/citizen-kane/umc.cmc.21zj0v11gnqbbqrebieh0vpk7)\n- Disney+: Available on Disney+\n- Netflix: Available on Netflix\nAnswer Status: Unsolved\nReason: The answer only addressed the first and second part of the query by providing the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' but did not provide information about the cast or a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US. The response was incomplete and did not fully address the query.\n\nQuery: \nPlease check if the domain 'example.com' is registered and valid.

If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3.

Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film.

Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project.

If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3. Severe Factual Error:\n        \u2022   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n    1. VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film.

        "llm_judge_prompt": "\nGiven a query and an answer provided by an AI agent, you now need to determine the answer_status of whether the well solved the query, i.e. whether the need of the query is satisfied. You need to output \"Unsolved\" or \"Solved\" and your reason. You must obey the following rules:\n\nYou should response \"Solved\" when:\n    1. If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3. Severe Factual Error:\n        \u2022   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n    1. VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide the runtime and IMDb ratings for these movies.\nAnswer 1: Here are some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US:\n\n1. Knives Out\n   - Runtime: 130 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 7.9/10\n   - Available on: Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video\n\n2. Jumanji: The Next Level\n   - Runtime: 110 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 6.7/10\n   - Available on: Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix\n\nPlease note that availability may vary depending on your location and streaming platform subscriptions. Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project. Can you help me find a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide me with the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' and the basic information about the cast, including their names and professions.\nAnswer 2: The movie 'Citizen Kane' is available on the following streaming platforms:\n- HBO Max: [Watch on HBO Max](https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXduU_gwwz-NvjAEAAAAC)\n- Amazon Prime Video: [Watch on Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Kane-Orson-Welles/dp/B000I9YLWG)\n- AppleTV+: [Watch on AppleTV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/citizen-kane/umc.cmc.21zj0v11gnqbbqrebieh0vpk7)\n- Disney+: Available on Disney+\n- Netflix: Available on Netflix\nAnswer Status: Unsolved\nReason: The answer only addressed the first and second part of the query by providing the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' but did not provide information about the cast or a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US. The response was incomplete and did not fully address the query.\n\nQuery: \nI recently watched a YouTube video about DIY home improvement projects, and I would like to get a summary of the video. Can you provide me with the summarized content in markdown format? Please include the video title, author, and ID. The video URL is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yzx7ihtCGBs.\nAnswer: \n\n\nNow give your reason and answer status in the following format:\n\nAnswer Status\nxxx (can only be \"Solved\" or \"Unsolved\")\nReason\nxxx\n"

If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3.

DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film.

        "llm_judge_prompt": "\nGiven a query and an answer provided by an AI agent, you now need to determine the answer_status of whether the well solved the query, i.e. whether the need of the query is satisfied. You need to output \"Unsolved\" or \"Solved\" and your reason. You must obey the following rules:\n\nYou should response \"Solved\" when:\n    1. If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3. Severe Factual Error:\n        \u2022   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n    1. VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US?

        "llm_judge_prompt": "\nGiven a query and an answer provided by an AI agent, you now need to determine the answer_status of whether the well solved the query, i.e. whether the need of the query is satisfied. You need to output \"Unsolved\" or \"Solved\" and your reason. You must obey the following rules:\n\nYou should response \"Solved\" when:\n    1. If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3. Severe Factual Error:\n        \u2022   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n    1. VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide the runtime and IMDb ratings for these movies.\nAnswer 1: Here are some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US:\n\n1. Knives Out\n   - Runtime: 130 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 7.9/10\n   - Available on: Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video\n\n2. Jumanji: The Next Level\n   - Runtime: 110 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 6.7/10\n   - Available on: Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix\n\nPlease note that availability may vary depending on your location and streaming platform subscriptions. Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project. Can you help me find a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide me with the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' and the basic information about the cast, including their names and professions.\nAnswer 2: The movie 'Citizen Kane' is available on the following streaming platforms:\n- HBO Max: [Watch on HBO Max](https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXduU_gwwz-NvjAEAAAAC)\n- Amazon Prime Video: [Watch on Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Kane-Orson-Welles/dp/B000I9YLWG)\n- AppleTV+: [Watch on AppleTV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/citizen-kane/umc.cmc.21zj0v11gnqbbqrebieh0vpk7)\n- Disney+: Available on Disney+\n- Netflix: Available on Netflix\nAnswer Status: Unsolved\nReason: The answer only addressed the first and second part of the query by providing the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' but did not provide information about the cast or a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US. The response was incomplete and did not fully address the query.\n\nQuery: \nI am working on a project and need to generate thumbnails for a list of URLs. Can you create small-sized (120 x 90 pixels) thumbnails for the URLs and let me know when they are ready to download?\nAnswer: \nhttp://www.example.com/thumbnail_s.jpg, http://www.example.org/thumbnail_s.jpg\n\nNow give your reason and answer status in the following format:\n\nAnswer Status\nxxx (can only be \"Solved\" or \"Unsolved\")\nReason\nxxx\n"

You need to output \"Unsolved\" or \"Solved\" and your reason. You must obey the following rules:\n\nYou should response \"Solved\" when:\n    1. If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3.

DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film.

        "llm_judge_prompt": "\nGiven a query and an answer provided by an AI agent, you now need to determine the answer_status of whether the well solved the query, i.e. whether the need of the query is satisfied. You need to output \"Unsolved\" or \"Solved\" and your reason. You must obey the following rules:\n\nYou should response \"Solved\" when:\n    1. If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3. Severe Factual Error:\n        \u2022   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n    1. VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide the runtime and IMDb ratings for these movies.\nAnswer 1: Here are some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US:\n\n1. Knives Out\n   - Runtime: 130 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 7.9/10\n   - Available on: Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video\n\n2. Jumanji: The Next Level\n   - Runtime: 110 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 6.7/10\n   - Available on: Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix\n\nPlease note that availability may vary depending on your location and streaming platform subscriptions. Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project. Can you help me find a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide me with the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' and the basic information about the cast, including their names and professions.\nAnswer 2: The movie 'Citizen Kane' is available on the following streaming platforms:\n- HBO Max: [Watch on HBO Max](https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXduU_gwwz-NvjAEAAAAC)\n- Amazon Prime Video: [Watch on Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Kane-Orson-Welles/dp/B000I9YLWG)\n- AppleTV+: [Watch on AppleTV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/citizen-kane/umc.cmc.21zj0v11gnqbbqrebieh0vpk7)\n- Disney+: Available on Disney+\n- Netflix: Available on Netflix\nAnswer Status: Unsolved\nReason: The answer only addressed the first and second part of the query by providing the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' but did not provide information about the cast or a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US. The response was incomplete and did not fully address the query.\n\nQuery: \nI'm organizing a virtual concert featuring Hatsune Miku, and I need captivating images to promote the event. Can you provide me with a random image of Hatsune Miku from the MikuAPI? It would be great if the image includes the artist's name, title, and a link to the source.

The reasoning process and function calling are enclosed within <think> </think> and <tool_call> </tool_call> tags. The results of the function calls will be given back to you after execution, and you can continue to call functions until you get the final answer for the user's question. Finally, if you have got the answer, enclose it within \\boxed{} with latex format and do not continue to call functions, i.e., <think> Based on the response from the function call, I get the weather information. </think> The weather in Beijing on 2025-04-01 is \\[ \\boxed{20C} \\].\n\nFor each function call, return a json object with function name and arguments within <tool_call></tool_call> XML tags:\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": <function-name>, \"arguments\": <args-json-object>}\n</tool_call><|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nI have an image named 'photo.jpg' and I want to rotate it 90 degrees clockwise and flip it vertically.

The reasoning process and function calling are enclosed within <think> </think> and <tool_call> </tool_call> tags. The results of the function calls will be given back to you after execution, and you can continue to call functions until you get the final answer for the user's question.

        "llm_judge_prompt": "\nGiven a query and an answer provided by an AI agent, you now need to determine the answer_status of whether the well solved the query, i.e. whether the need of the query is satisfied. You need to output \"Unsolved\" or \"Solved\" and your reason. You must obey the following rules:\n\nYou should response \"Solved\" when:\n    1. If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3. Severe Factual Error:\n        \u2022   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n    1. VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide the runtime and IMDb ratings for these movies.\nAnswer 1: Here are some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US:\n\n1. Knives Out\n   - Runtime: 130 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 7.9/10\n   - Available on: Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video\n\n2. Jumanji: The Next Level\n   - Runtime: 110 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 6.7/10\n   - Available on: Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix\n\nPlease note that availability may vary depending on your location and streaming platform subscriptions. Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project. Can you help me find a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide me with the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' and the basic information about the cast, including their names and professions.\nAnswer 2: The movie 'Citizen Kane' is available on the following streaming platforms:\n- HBO Max: [Watch on HBO Max](https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXduU_gwwz-NvjAEAAAAC)\n- Amazon Prime Video: [Watch on Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Kane-Orson-Welles/dp/B000I9YLWG)\n- AppleTV+: [Watch on AppleTV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/citizen-kane/umc.cmc.21zj0v11gnqbbqrebieh0vpk7)\n- Disney+: Available on Disney+\n- Netflix: Available on Netflix\nAnswer Status: Unsolved\nReason: The answer only addressed the first and second part of the query by providing the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' but did not provide information about the cast or a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US. The response was incomplete and did not fully address the query.\n\nQuery: \nI have an image named 'photo.jpg' and I want to rotate it 90 degrees clockwise and flip it vertically. Can you also save it in the 'edited_images' folder?\nAnswer: \nphoto.jpg edited and saved in edited_images folder\n\nNow give your reason and answer status in the following format:\n\nAnswer Status\nxxx (can only be \"Solved\" or \"Unsolved\")\nReason\nxxx\n"

The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3. Severe Factual Error:\n        \u2022   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n    1. VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide the runtime and IMDb ratings for these movies.\nAnswer 1: Here are some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US:\n\n1. Knives Out\n   - Runtime: 130 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 7.9/10\n   - Available on: Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video\n\n2. Jumanji: The Next Level\n   - Runtime: 110 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 6.7/10\n   - Available on: Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix\n\nPlease note that availability may vary depending on your location and streaming platform subscriptions. Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project. Can you help me find a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide me with the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' and the basic information about the cast, including their names and professions.\nAnswer 2: The movie 'Citizen Kane' is available on the following streaming platforms:\n- HBO Max: [Watch on HBO Max](https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXduU_gwwz-NvjAEAAAAC)\n- Amazon Prime Video: [Watch on Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Kane-Orson-Welles/dp/B000I9YLWG)\n- AppleTV+: [Watch on AppleTV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/citizen-kane/umc.cmc.21zj0v11gnqbbqrebieh0vpk7)\n- Disney+: Available on Disney+\n- Netflix: Available on Netflix\nAnswer Status: Unsolved\nReason: The answer only addressed the first and second part of the query by providing the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' but did not provide information about the cast or a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US. The response was incomplete and did not fully address the query.\n\nQuery: \nI am working on a gaming application and I need to calculate the KD (kill-death) ratio for a player. Can you provide an API that calculates the KD ratio based on the number of kills and deaths? Additionally, I would like to generate a random UUID for the player. This will help in identifying the player uniquely.\nAnswer: \nKD Ratio: 2.5, UUID: 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000\n\nNow give your reason and answer status in the following format:\n\nAnswer Status\nxxx (can only be \"Solved\" or \"Unsolved\")\nReason\nxxx\n"

        "llm_judge_prompt": "\nGiven a query and an answer provided by an AI agent, you now need to determine the answer_status of whether the well solved the query, i.e. whether the need of the query is satisfied. You need to output \"Unsolved\" or \"Solved\" and your reason. You must obey the following rules:\n\nYou should response \"Solved\" when:\n    1. If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3. Severe Factual Error:\n        \u2022   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n    1. VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide the runtime and IMDb ratings for these movies.\nAnswer 1: Here are some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US:\n\n1. Knives Out\n   - Runtime: 130 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 7.9/10\n   - Available on: Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video\n\n2. Jumanji: The Next Level\n   - Runtime: 110 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 6.7/10\n   - Available on: Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix\n\nPlease note that availability may vary depending on your location and streaming platform subscriptions. Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project. Can you help me find a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide me with the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' and the basic information about the cast, including their names and professions.\nAnswer 2: The movie 'Citizen Kane' is available on the following streaming platforms:\n- HBO Max: [Watch on HBO Max](https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXduU_gwwz-NvjAEAAAAC)\n- Amazon Prime Video: [Watch on Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Kane-Orson-Welles/dp/B000I9YLWG)\n- AppleTV+: [Watch on AppleTV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/citizen-kane/umc.cmc.21zj0v11gnqbbqrebieh0vpk7)\n- Disney+: Available on Disney+\n- Netflix: Available on Netflix\nAnswer Status: Unsolved\nReason: The answer only addressed the first and second part of the query by providing the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' but did not provide information about the cast or a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US. The response was incomplete and did not fully address the query.\n\nQuery: \nMy family wants to check the status of our website's endpoint.

The reasoning process and function calling are enclosed within <think> </think> and <tool_call> </tool_call> tags. The results of the function calls will be given back to you after execution, and you can continue to call functions until you get the final answer for the user's question. Finally, if you have got the answer, enclose it within \\boxed{} with latex format and do not continue to call functions, i.e., <think> Based on the response from the function call, I get the weather information. </think> The weather in Beijing on 2025-04-01 is \\[ \\boxed{20C} \\].\n\nFor each function call, return a json object with function name and arguments within <tool_call></tool_call> XML tags:\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": <function-name>, \"arguments\": <args-json-object>}\n</tool_call><|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nI want to check the status of my recent order.

If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3.

Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film.

If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3.

You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film.

        "llm_judge_prompt": "\nGiven a query and an answer provided by an AI agent, you now need to determine the answer_status of whether the well solved the query, i.e. whether the need of the query is satisfied. You need to output \"Unsolved\" or \"Solved\" and your reason. You must obey the following rules:\n\nYou should response \"Solved\" when:\n    1. If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3. Severe Factual Error:\n        \u2022   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n    1. VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide the runtime and IMDb ratings for these movies.\nAnswer 1: Here are some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US:\n\n1.

Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project.

Also, provide me with the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' and the basic information about the cast, including their names and professions.\nAnswer 2: The movie 'Citizen Kane' is available on the following streaming platforms:\n- HBO Max: [Watch on HBO Max](https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXduU_gwwz-NvjAEAAAAC)\n- Amazon Prime Video: [Watch on Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Kane-Orson-Welles/dp/B000I9YLWG)\n- AppleTV+: [Watch on AppleTV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/citizen-kane/umc.cmc.21zj0v11gnqbbqrebieh0vpk7)\n- Disney+: Available on Disney+\n- Netflix: Available on Netflix\nAnswer Status: Unsolved\nReason: The answer only addressed the first and second part of the query by providing the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' but did not provide information about the cast or a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US. The response was incomplete and did not fully address the query.\n\nQuery: \nMy friend is working on a research project that involves analyzing sensor data. Can you help her retrieve the variables of a specified data source and provide the details of each variable, including the last value written to it? Furthermore, fetch the values of a specific variable along with their timestamps?\nAnswer: \nno answer\n\nNow give your reason and answer status in the following format:\n\nAnswer Status\nxxx (can only be \"Solved\" or \"Unsolved\")\nReason\nxxx\n"

If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3. Severe Factual Error:\n        \u2022   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n    1. VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film.

If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3.

VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film.

You need to output \"Unsolved\" or \"Solved\" and your reason. You must obey the following rules:\n\nYou should response \"Solved\" when:\n    1. If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3. Severe Factual Error:\n        \u2022   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n    1.

DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide the runtime and IMDb ratings for these movies.\nAnswer 1: Here are some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US:\n\n1. Knives Out\n   - Runtime: 130 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 7.9/10\n   - Available on: Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video\n\n2.

Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project. Can you help me find a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide me with the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' and the basic information about the cast, including their names and professions.\nAnswer 2: The movie 'Citizen Kane' is available on the following streaming platforms:\n- HBO Max: [Watch on HBO Max](https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXduU_gwwz-NvjAEAAAAC)\n- Amazon Prime Video: [Watch on Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Kane-Orson-Welles/dp/B000I9YLWG)\n- AppleTV+: [Watch on AppleTV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/citizen-kane/umc.cmc.21zj0v11gnqbbqrebieh0vpk7)\n- Disney+: Available on Disney+\n- Netflix: Available on Netflix\nAnswer Status: Unsolved\nReason: The answer only addressed the first and second part of the query by providing the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' but did not provide information about the cast or a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US. The response was incomplete and did not fully address the query.\n\nQuery: \nCan you fetch the details of my recent orders?

You need to output \"Unsolved\" or \"Solved\" and your reason. You must obey the following rules:\n\nYou should response \"Solved\" when:\n    1. If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3.

DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film.

If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3.

DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide the runtime and IMDb ratings for these movies.\nAnswer 1: Here are some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US:\n\n1. Knives Out\n   - Runtime: 130 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 7.9/10\n   - Available on: Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video\n\n2. Jumanji: The Next Level\n   - Runtime: 110 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 6.7/10\n   - Available on: Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix\n\nPlease note that availability may vary depending on your location and streaming platform subscriptions. Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project. Can you help me find a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide me with the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' and the basic information about the cast, including their names and professions.\nAnswer 2: The movie 'Citizen Kane' is available on the following streaming platforms:\n- HBO Max: [Watch on HBO Max](https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXduU_gwwz-NvjAEAAAAC)\n- Amazon Prime Video: [Watch on Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Kane-Orson-Welles/dp/B000I9YLWG)\n- AppleTV+: [Watch on AppleTV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/citizen-kane/umc.cmc.21zj0v11gnqbbqrebieh0vpk7)\n- Disney+: Available on Disney+\n- Netflix: Available on Netflix\nAnswer Status: Unsolved\nReason: The answer only addressed the first and second part of the query by providing the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' but did not provide information about the cast or a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US. The response was incomplete and did not fully address the query.\n\nQuery: \nI am working on a project that requires unique IDs for each document.

Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project.

The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3. Severe Factual Error:\n        \u2022   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n    1. VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide the runtime and IMDb ratings for these movies.\nAnswer 1: Here are some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US:\n\n1. Knives Out\n   - Runtime: 130 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 7.9/10\n   - Available on: Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video\n\n2. Jumanji: The Next Level\n   - Runtime: 110 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 6.7/10\n   - Available on: Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix\n\nPlease note that availability may vary depending on your location and streaming platform subscriptions. Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project. Can you help me find a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide me with the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' and the basic information about the cast, including their names and professions.\nAnswer 2: The movie 'Citizen Kane' is available on the following streaming platforms:\n- HBO Max: [Watch on HBO Max](https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXduU_gwwz-NvjAEAAAAC)\n- Amazon Prime Video: [Watch on Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Kane-Orson-Welles/dp/B000I9YLWG)\n- AppleTV+: [Watch on AppleTV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/citizen-kane/umc.cmc.21zj0v11gnqbbqrebieh0vpk7)\n- Disney+: Available on Disney+\n- Netflix: Available on Netflix\nAnswer Status: Unsolved\nReason: The answer only addressed the first and second part of the query by providing the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' but did not provide information about the cast or a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US. The response was incomplete and did not fully address the query.\n\nQuery: \nMy company is developing an IoT application and needs to gather insights from the sensor data. Can you help us by providing the variables of a specified data source on Ubidots and their corresponding details, including the last value written to each variable?\nAnswer: \nTemperature: ID: temp101, Name: Temperature, Unit: Celsius, Last Value: 22.5, Created At: 2023-04-01T12:00:00Z, Humidity: ID: hum101, Name: Humidity, Unit: %, Last Value: 45, Created At: 2023-04-01T12:00:00Z, Light Intensity: ID: light101, Name: Light Intensity, Unit: lx, Last Value: 300, Created At: 2023-04-01T12:00:00Z\n\nNow give your reason and answer status in the following format:\n\nAnswer Status\nxxx (can only be \"Solved\" or \"Unsolved\")\nReason\nxxx\n"

If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3. Severe Factual Error:\n        \u2022   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n    1. VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film.

Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings.

You need to output \"Unsolved\" or \"Solved\" and your reason. You must obey the following rules:\n\nYou should response \"Solved\" when:\n    1. If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3. Severe Factual Error:\n        \u2022   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n    1. VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide the runtime and IMDb ratings for these movies.\nAnswer 1: Here are some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US:\n\n1. Knives Out\n   - Runtime: 130 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 7.9/10\n   - Available on: Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video\n\n2. Jumanji: The Next Level\n   - Runtime: 110 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 6.7/10\n   - Available on: Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix\n\nPlease note that availability may vary depending on your location and streaming platform subscriptions. Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project. Can you help me find a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide me with the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' and the basic information about the cast, including their names and professions.\nAnswer 2: The movie 'Citizen Kane' is available on the following streaming platforms:\n- HBO Max: [Watch on HBO Max](https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXduU_gwwz-NvjAEAAAAC)\n- Amazon Prime Video: [Watch on Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Kane-Orson-Welles/dp/B000I9YLWG)\n- AppleTV+: [Watch on AppleTV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/citizen-kane/umc.cmc.21zj0v11gnqbbqrebieh0vpk7)\n- Disney+: Available on Disney+\n- Netflix: Available on Netflix\nAnswer Status: Unsolved\nReason: The answer only addressed the first and second part of the query by providing the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' but did not provide information about the cast or a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US. The response was incomplete and did not fully address the query.\n\nQuery: \nI'm working on a research project about pet images and their alt text in different languages.

If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3.

DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US?

Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project.

You need to output \"Unsolved\" or \"Solved\" and your reason. You must obey the following rules:\n\nYou should response \"Solved\" when:\n    1. If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3.

DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film.

You need to output \"Unsolved\" or \"Solved\" and your reason. You must obey the following rules:\n\nYou should response \"Solved\" when:\n    1. If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3. Severe Factual Error:\n        \u2022   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n    1. VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US?

If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3.

DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film.

        "llm_judge_prompt": "\nGiven a query and an answer provided by an AI agent, you now need to determine the answer_status of whether the well solved the query, i.e. whether the need of the query is satisfied. You need to output \"Unsolved\" or \"Solved\" and your reason. You must obey the following rules:\n\nYou should response \"Solved\" when:\n    1. If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3. Severe Factual Error:\n        \u2022   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n    1. VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide the runtime and IMDb ratings for these movies.\nAnswer 1: Here are some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US:\n\n1. Knives Out\n   - Runtime: 130 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 7.9/10\n   - Available on: Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video\n\n2. Jumanji: The Next Level\n   - Runtime: 110 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 6.7/10\n   - Available on: Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix\n\nPlease note that availability may vary depending on your location and streaming platform subscriptions. Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project. Can you help me find a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide me with the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' and the basic information about the cast, including their names and professions.\nAnswer 2: The movie 'Citizen Kane' is available on the following streaming platforms:\n- HBO Max: [Watch on HBO Max](https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXduU_gwwz-NvjAEAAAAC)\n- Amazon Prime Video: [Watch on Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Kane-Orson-Welles/dp/B000I9YLWG)\n- AppleTV+: [Watch on AppleTV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/citizen-kane/umc.cmc.21zj0v11gnqbbqrebieh0vpk7)\n- Disney+: Available on Disney+\n- Netflix: Available on Netflix\nAnswer Status: Unsolved\nReason: The answer only addressed the first and second part of the query by providing the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' but did not provide information about the cast or a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US. The response was incomplete and did not fully address the query.\n\nQuery: \nMy family and I are starting a Minecraft server and want to convert our usernames into UUIDs. Can you recommend an API that performs this conversion? Additionally, we would like to fetch our individual skins using the generated UUIDs.\nAnswer: \nUUID: 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000, Skin: <skin_data>\n\nNow give your reason and answer status in the following format:\n\nAnswer Status\nxxx (can only be \"Solved\" or \"Unsolved\")\nReason\nxxx\n"

The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3. Severe Factual Error:\n        \u2022   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n    1. VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide the runtime and IMDb ratings for these movies.\nAnswer 1: Here are some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US:\n\n1. Knives Out\n   - Runtime: 130 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 7.9/10\n   - Available on: Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video\n\n2. Jumanji: The Next Level\n   - Runtime: 110 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 6.7/10\n   - Available on: Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix\n\nPlease note that availability may vary depending on your location and streaming platform subscriptions. Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project. Can you help me find a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide me with the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' and the basic information about the cast, including their names and professions.\nAnswer 2: The movie 'Citizen Kane' is available on the following streaming platforms:\n- HBO Max: [Watch on HBO Max](https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXduU_gwwz-NvjAEAAAAC)\n- Amazon Prime Video: [Watch on Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Kane-Orson-Welles/dp/B000I9YLWG)\n- AppleTV+: [Watch on AppleTV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/citizen-kane/umc.cmc.21zj0v11gnqbbqrebieh0vpk7)\n- Disney+: Available on Disney+\n- Netflix: Available on Netflix\nAnswer Status: Unsolved\nReason: The answer only addressed the first and second part of the query by providing the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' but did not provide information about the cast or a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US. The response was incomplete and did not fully address the query.\n\nQuery: \nCan you search for the top 40 movie torrents with the keywords 'science fiction' and 'thriller'? Additionally, give me the monthly top 100 TV-show torrents.\nAnswer: \nTop 100 TV-show torrents: Monthly Top 100 TV-shows Torrents. Movie torrents search issue: Sorry,quantity between 1 and 40.\n\nNow give your reason and answer status in the following format:\n\nAnswer Status\nxxx (can only be \"Solved\" or \"Unsolved\")\nReason\nxxx\n"

If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3.

DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film.

If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3. Severe Factual Error:\n        \u2022   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n    1. VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film.

If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3.

DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film.

Knives Out\n   - Runtime: 130 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 7.9/10\n   - Available on: Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video\n\n2. Jumanji: The Next Level\n   - Runtime: 110 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 6.7/10\n   - Available on: Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix\n\nPlease note that availability may vary depending on your location and streaming platform subscriptions. Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project. Can you help me find a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide me with the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' and the basic information about the cast, including their names and professions.\nAnswer 2: The movie 'Citizen Kane' is available on the following streaming platforms:\n- HBO Max: [Watch on HBO Max](https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXduU_gwwz-NvjAEAAAAC)\n- Amazon Prime Video: [Watch on Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Kane-Orson-Welles/dp/B000I9YLWG)\n- AppleTV+: [Watch on AppleTV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/citizen-kane/umc.cmc.21zj0v11gnqbbqrebieh0vpk7)\n- Disney+: Available on Disney+\n- Netflix: Available on Netflix\nAnswer Status: Unsolved\nReason: The answer only addressed the first and second part of the query by providing the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' but did not provide information about the cast or a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US. The response was incomplete and did not fully address the query.\n\nQuery: \nMy company is interested in retrieving the list of variables for a data source with ID 'xyz789'.

If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3.

        "llm_judge_prompt": "\nGiven a query and an answer provided by an AI agent, you now need to determine the answer_status of whether the well solved the query, i.e. whether the need of the query is satisfied. You need to output \"Unsolved\" or \"Solved\" and your reason. You must obey the following rules:\n\nYou should response \"Solved\" when:\n    1. If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3. Severe Factual Error:\n        \u2022   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n    1. VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US?

Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings.

You need to output \"Unsolved\" or \"Solved\" and your reason. You must obey the following rules:\n\nYou should response \"Solved\" when:\n    1. If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3. Severe Factual Error:\n        \u2022   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n    1. VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide the runtime and IMDb ratings for these movies.\nAnswer 1: Here are some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US:\n\n1. Knives Out\n   - Runtime: 130 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 7.9/10\n   - Available on: Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video\n\n2. Jumanji: The Next Level\n   - Runtime: 110 minutes\n   - IMDb Rating: 6.7/10\n   - Available on: Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix\n\nPlease note that availability may vary depending on your location and streaming platform subscriptions. Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project. Can you help me find a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide me with the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' and the basic information about the cast, including their names and professions.\nAnswer 2: The movie 'Citizen Kane' is available on the following streaming platforms:\n- HBO Max: [Watch on HBO Max](https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXduU_gwwz-NvjAEAAAAC)\n- Amazon Prime Video: [Watch on Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Kane-Orson-Welles/dp/B000I9YLWG)\n- AppleTV+: [Watch on AppleTV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/citizen-kane/umc.cmc.21zj0v11gnqbbqrebieh0vpk7)\n- Disney+: Available on Disney+\n- Netflix: Available on Netflix\nAnswer Status: Unsolved\nReason: The answer only addressed the first and second part of the query by providing the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' but did not provide information about the cast or a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US. The response was incomplete and did not fully address the query.\n\nQuery: \nCan you help me analyze the number of pages indexed in Google for my company's website? The URL is 'www.example.com'.\nAnswer: \n500\n\nNow give your reason and answer status in the following format:\n\nAnswer Status\nxxx (can only be \"Solved\" or \"Unsolved\")\nReason\nxxx\n"

If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3.

DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US?

Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project. Can you help me find a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide me with the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' and the basic information about the cast, including their names and professions.\nAnswer 2: The movie 'Citizen Kane' is available on the following streaming platforms:\n- HBO Max: [Watch on HBO Max](https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXduU_gwwz-NvjAEAAAAC)\n- Amazon Prime Video: [Watch on Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Kane-Orson-Welles/dp/B000I9YLWG)\n- AppleTV+: [Watch on AppleTV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/citizen-kane/umc.cmc.21zj0v11gnqbbqrebieh0vpk7)\n- Disney+: Available on Disney+\n- Netflix: Available on Netflix\nAnswer Status: Unsolved\nReason: The answer only addressed the first and second part of the query by providing the streaming sources for the movie 'Citizen Kane' but did not provide information about the cast or a list of critically acclaimed movies available on streaming platforms in the US. The response was incomplete and did not fully address the query.\n\nQuery: \nAs a developer, I am interested in the current status of Judge0 Extra CE.

You need to output \"Unsolved\" or \"Solved\" and your reason. You must obey the following rules:\n\nYou should response \"Solved\" when:\n    1. If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3. Severe Factual Error:\n        \u2022   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n    1.

DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US?

Enjoy your movie night!\nAnswer Status: Solved0304\nReason: The answer addressed all parts of subqueries by providing a list of popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US, along with their runtime and IMDb ratings. Whether the film is horror is a factual matter that does not to be checked.\n\nQuery 2: I'm a screenwriter looking for inspiration for my next project.

You need to output \"Unsolved\" or \"Solved\" and your reason. You must obey the following rules:\n\nYou should response \"Solved\" when:\n    1. If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3. Severe Factual Error:\n        \u2022   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n    1. VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US?

You need to output \"Unsolved\" or \"Solved\" and your reason. You must obey the following rules:\n\nYou should response \"Solved\" when:\n    1. If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3. Severe Factual Error:\n        \u2022   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n    1. VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film.

The results of the function calls will be given back to you after execution, and you can continue to call functions until you get the final answer for the user's question.

This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3. Severe Factual Error:\n        \u2022   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n    1. VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide the runtime and IMDb ratings for these movies.\nAnswer 1: Here are some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US:\n\n1.

The response was incomplete and did not fully address the query.\n\nQuery: \nI'm a movie enthusiast and I'm looking for recommendations. Can you help me discover movies from different genres? It would be great if you could provide the movie details such as the title, overview, release date, and average vote.\nAnswer: \nTitle: Godzilla vs. Kong, Overview: In a time when monsters walk the Earth, humanity's fight for its future sets Godzilla and Kong on a collision course that will see the two most powerful forces of nature on the planet collide in a spectacular battle for the ages., Release Date: 2021-03-24, Average Vote: 7.676\n\nNow give your reason and answer status in the following format:\n\nAnswer Status\nxxx (can only be \"Solved\" or \"Unsolved\")\nReason\nxxx\n"

        "llm_judge_prompt": "\nGiven a query and an answer provided by an AI agent, you now need to determine the answer_status of whether the well solved the query, i.e. whether the need of the query is satisfied. You need to output \"Unsolved\" or \"Solved\" and your reason. You must obey the following rules:\n\nYou should response \"Solved\" when:\n    1. If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is \"Solved\". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n\t2.\tConsider only Completeness:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.\n\t3.\tFor Multi-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tFor queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered \u201cSolved\u201d.\n\t4.\tGenuine Attempt :\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that \u201cnothing\u201d is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).\n\nYou should response \"Unsolved\" when:\n    1.\tRefusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, I can't help with that\u201d).\n\t    \u2022\tThe answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.\n\t2.\tMulti-part Queries:\n\t    \u2022\tIf the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.\n    3. Severe Factual Error:\n        \u2022   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n    1. VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.\n    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.\n\t2.\tFocus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.\n\t3.\tAnswer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuery 1: I'm planning a movie night with my friends and we want to watch a horror film. Can you recommend some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US? Also, provide the runtime and IMDb ratings for these movies.\nAnswer 1: Here are some popular horror movies available on streaming platforms in the US:\n\n1.
